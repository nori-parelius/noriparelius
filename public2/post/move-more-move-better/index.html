<p>I used to be a nerdy little bookworm as a kid and as a teenager. And honestly a bit of a couch potato. If I could sit in a comfy armchair with a book, I would sit in a comfy armchair with a book.</p>
<p>I also used to be a &ldquo;good girl&rdquo;. Doing what I was expected to do and following the rules both spoken and implied. So I would sit &ldquo;properly&rdquo;, never run around in the corridors and favour academic achievements over physical prowess.</p>
<p>It was subconcious - I never really decided not to move - but it was happening and it had consequences.</p>
<p>I was just 12 when a doctor told me that my knee pain was due to worn cartilages and there was nothing to do about it. By the time I entered my twenties I not only had bad knees, but also a wonky ankle, flat feet and regular lower back pain.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think I even understood how much it affected me mentally&hellip;</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t happy with the way I looked and I ingored as best as I could the way I felt in my own body.</p>

<h2 id="it-changed-thankfully">It changed, thankfully</h2>
<p>It happened in 2015. The beginning of the change, I mean. It was a cold Norwegian January and I was an ever-so-nerdy bookish PhD student. That day I went to a proper gym - probably for the first time in my life. I was suffering from a new-years-resolutionitis and had a vague feeling I should &ldquo;start exercising (somehow)&rdquo;. I was looking for something that would require as little energy and time as possible.</p>
<p>Well that trip to the gym never repeated itself. But boy oh boy, was it an eye-opener. I was weak, clumsy, awkward and stiff. I had no idea how to move.</p>
<p>Thankfully, I had enough self-awareness left to realize I had no control and was on my way to an injury.</p>
<p>Coming home that day, I started searching the internet. Trying to answer questions like why can&rsquo;t I squat? And this was the real beginning. The nerd&rsquo;s way.</p>
<p>I was studying biophysics and suddenly realized that the mechanics of the human body was actually right up my alley!</p>
<p>I loved reading about it. And I still do!</p>
<p>And before I knew it, I was applying what I was reading to myself and eventually advising others. Also reading more, taking courses, and learning more.</p>
<p>Movement became my passion.</p>
<h2 id="reconnecting-with-myself">Reconnecting with myself</h2>
<p>I don&rsquo;t go to the gym. I don&rsquo;t really play sports. I have a full time job and two kids and I don&rsquo;t enjoy gyms and sports enough to make time for them.</p>
<p>Instead I just move.</p>
<p>I make space for movement in my daily life and in my mind, because I know now that it is essential.</p>
<p>My movement practice keeps me
pain free, confident,
moving with ease,
able to enjoy physical activity and
connected to my body and the world around me.</p>
<p>I finally feel at home in my body. I finally feel like I belong. And it&rsquo;s a good feeling.</p>
