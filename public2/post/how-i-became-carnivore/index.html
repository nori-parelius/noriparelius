    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links dark-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>I don’t eat a “varied and balanced diet” anymore. I don’t do five a day. There is no rainbow on my plate. And no holy (whole)  grains.  Zero fibre,  actually. On the other hand, I eat lots of saturated fat, cholesterol and salt.</p>
<p>I eat meat, eggs, fish, salt and water. And that&rsquo;s pretty much it 99% of the time.</p>
<p>And believe it or not I have never felt better.</p>
<p>How did I get here? Let us start from the middle&hellip;</p>
<h2 id="no-matter-how-hard-i-tried-everything-was-wrong">No matter how hard I tried, everything was wrong</h2>
<p>My first daugther was a bit over a year old and I was having probably the most difficult time of my life.</p>
<p>Most people would consider our diet at that time very healthy. It was full of fruits and vegetables, whole grains, heart-healthy plant fats and only relatively small amounts of meat. Everything was prepared at home from fresh ingredients.</p>
<h3 id="child-with-alergies">Child with alergies</h3>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t really have much choice. From the moment the kiddo was born, it was quite clear that she inherited her mother&rsquo;s disposition for allergies. We quickly identified milk and eggs as the main culprit and I dropped them from my diet like a hot potato, because I didn&rsquo;t want to stop breastfeeding her.</p>
<p>But that wasn&rsquo;t enough. She kept reacting to random things I ate. And when she started solids also to the things she ate. It was a nightmare trying to identify the culprits and medical testing provided only some answers, and clearly not all. So I kept eliminating more and more foods from my diet.</p>
<p>She was actually doing very well for a child with allergies - most likely thanks to the breastmilk - but I on the other hand&hellip; not so much.</p>
<h3 id="i-started-falling-apart">I started falling apart</h3>

<p>It slowly crept up on me, but by the time she was a year, I was hardly recognising myself. I was skinny, weak, perpetually tired and always sick.  Any virus passing by would get me and keep me miserable for many weeks. I even managed to break two of my ribs in a coughing fit.  Really.</p>
<p>My hands were covered in eczema I couldn’t get rid of for ages. My digestion was miserable. I was having so much bloating and unexpected trips to the bathroom that it was often difficult to leave the house.  But the worst of it was the mental part. I was anxious and angry and scared. Sometimes I didn&rsquo;t even know why. I was just not coping at all.</p>
<p>According to my doctor, everything looked fine.</p>
<h2 id="just-meat-are-you-out-of-your-gourd">Just meat? Are you out of your gourd?</h2>
<p>It continued for way too long without much improvement. Until one day in May 2019, when I was 30 years old and the little one has just turned two.</p>
<p>And here I have to give credit to my husband who showed me a <a href="https://imgur.com/gallery/mkzQ6Kk">picture of married couple</a> he found online and asked me how old I though they were. I guessed maybe late thirties, at most early fourties. I was super wrong. She was 46 and he was 61.</p>
<p>And they attributed their youthfull looks and good health to only having eaten beef for the last 20 years.</p>
<h3 id="carnivore">Carnivore</h3>
<p>The people in the picture were <a href="https://www.allthingscarnivore.com/joe-and-charlene-andersons-carnivore-diet-experience/">Joe and Charlene Andersen</a> and as we quickly found out, they are far from the only ones following some version of the so-called carnivore diet, and reporting incredible health benefits.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Carnivore&hellip; as in no plant foods at all. I was flabbergasted. It can&rsquo;t be!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I mean, everyone knows, that vegetables are nutrition, right? You can&rsquo;t live without vegetables!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Or?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Turns out you can. And more than that. You can thrive. We discovered a big community of carnivores online, quite a few of them doctors, researchers and dieticians. And so many stories from all sorts of people. They often sounded like miracles. People who went into remission from their &ldquo;uncurable&rdquo; chronic diseases, from eczemas, depression, anxiety, through Crohn&rsquo;s, type 2 diabetes, psoriasis, juvenile arthritis, to epilepsy, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and tooth cavities&hellip;</p>
<p>Some even had their grey hair grow dark again.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I usually follow the rule that if something sound too good to be true, then it probably isn&rsquo;t true.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="but-there-wasn-t-much-to-lose-this-time-dot">But there wasn&rsquo;t much to lose this time.</h2>
<p>Of course I didn&rsquo;t go in blindly. I read and I read and I double-checked and carefully considered arguments from all the sides. I was a PhD student at the time and let me tell you, a PhD is mostly a degree in reading scientific literature. So that is what I did here too. And things did check out and did make sense. The last thing left was to try.</p>
<p>My personal little miracle</p>
<p>We were going to try it for a month. It has now been over 3 years. It really felt like experiencing my own little miracle.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I do indeed thrive.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Digestion</strong> - better than ever. And it used to be really bad. Now I don&rsquo;t think about 99% of the time. Have you ever experienced zero bloat? It&rsquo;s glorious.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Skin</strong> - better than ever. Eczema was gone within a week and acne a few weaks later. Plus I don&rsquo;t burn in the sun anymore. Go figure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Pollen allergies</strong> - basically gone. As long as I am perfectly plant free (including spices) I don&rsquo;t experience any symptoms. And I used to have terrible allergies fo 9 months out of a year!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mental health</strong> - much better. I didn&rsquo;t realize I used to have anxiety until it was gone. The impending sense of doom now only returns when I eat some sugar.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Resistance to getting sick</strong> - definitely better. I still get sick, seeing that I live with two small people that will gladly sneeze in your eyeball and that visit a breeding gourn for pathogens daily (a.k.a. kindergarten). But the illnesses are milder and pass much faster.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Over the last three years I have been experimenting with adding other foods to my diet and every time I end up going back to a pure carnivore of meat, fish, eggs, salt and water. Because many of the benefits I mentioned here disappear for me, once I add some plant foods. Some people don&rsquo;t feel a difference from adding some coffee or avocado or spices or other plants, but I really do.</p>
<p>And for as long as this will make me feel the best, I will continue.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The carnivore diet and how and why it works has remained a source of fascination for me. I have never before experienced such a profound change. I wouldn&rsquo;t hesitate to say that carnivore saved my life. And it all makes sense.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why I just can&rsquo;t keep it to myself.</p>
