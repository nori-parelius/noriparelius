      <description>(The image above is AI generated, the rest is not.)&#xA;I believe this is my fifth(?!) attempt at blogging in the last 12 years. Some of those blogs were very short-lived, some survived for longer. None of the previous four are out there anymore. I had my reasons for starting each of the blogs, but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t something I thought about much, not something that was clear in my mind. As I was starting yet another blog (this one), I decided to be a bit more mindful and conscious of what my goals actually are.</description>

      <description>I really really tried to start an online business, but it was just an endless struggle. I just couldn&amp;rsquo;t get myself to do the things and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t get it right. And so I finally stopped. It was a relief and a disappointment at the same time. And it actually took me close to a year to figure out what went &amp;ldquo;wrong&amp;rdquo;, and why it&amp;rsquo;s for the best.&#xA;If you are looking for a guide on how to start making money online, this is not it.</description>
