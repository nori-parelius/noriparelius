The illusion of control.

It's the end of March and so rather late to be doing a review of the previous year, but here we are anyway. The lessons I have learned in 2024 are still coming up for me, chief among them: the issue of control.

I have spent a big part of last year [struggling to recover from from my third round of Covid](https://noriparelius.com/post/way-out-of-burnout/), and looking back at it, doing a terrible job of it. I was fighting myself every step of the way, refusing to accept where I was and how I felt, refusing to allow myself the rest I needed. But despite my stubborn stupidity, I recovered.

The all-encompassing fatigue and the guilt I felt about it sent me straight into the arms of a false friend: toxic productivity. 

It was about a year ago that I read (and really enjoyed) David Allen's Getting Things Done (GTD). And it was about 6 months later that I abandonned it, and never looked back. If you are a GTD fan, you might say that I did it wrong. And maybe I did. But I also thought really long and hard about what went wrong and why, and that is what I will share with you now. 

For the people who are not fans of GTD, it is basically a system for managing all your stuff. It's an incredibly popular and well-thought through framework, and I feel like the name "Getting Things Done" really misrepresents what it is. I have heard about it quite a few times before I decided to read it, simply because I was not interested in hustle and increased productivity, but I picked it up eventually and was pleasantly surprised. GTD is not about getting things done, it's about mental clarity. 

You capture all the "stuff" tugging at your mind in an inbox or several inboxes (a physical tray, a notes app, a paper notebook, or whatever else), and then go through your inbox regularly and turn your "stuff" into references -- information you want to keep, or projects and next action items -- things you want to do. These are then kept in a bunch of lists to make sure you see the items you need to see when you need them. 

It's a simple and elegant system based on some key ideas: 
* you need to manage your "open loops" -- anything incomplete that occupies your mind, else it will take up mental resources as your mind unconsciously keeps track of it
* to get the open loops off of your mind, you need to decide what they are -- define the desired outcome, decide on a next action (something that is actually actionable), and put it into a trusted system where you know you will find it
