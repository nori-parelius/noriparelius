It's easy to think that discipline, consistency and pushing yourself are the only way to fulfill your dreams. But what if you find that instead of crushing your goals you are only yourself?


## What if I don't want to go hard? {#what-if-i-don-t-want-to-go-hard}

I was talking to a few friends the other day, and the conversation turned to exercise. The idea seemed to be that you should do what you hate. Burpees? Sprints? Of course you hate them. That's why you should do them! Prove to yourself that you can do hard things! Just look at David Goggings and what he achieved. Stay hard!

And you know, I get it. I really do. It's good to stretch the boundaries of our comfort zone fron time to time, and to challenge ourselves and show ourselves that we are capable. But as I was sitting there I couldn't help but think that I don't want to do things I hate. I _don't want to_ be _hard_. I actually want to become _softer_.

I felt like that one driver driving in the wrong direction on a highway, and I didn't want to ruin my friends' vibe, so I didn't say anything. A year ago, I don't think I would have been able to admit to myself without guilt and thoughts of laziness that this message was not resonating with me. Now, after some nine months of dealing with burnout/mild long Covid, my views on productivity and my understanding of myself have shifted enough that I could see I wasn't really the right target audience here.

My limits have been pushed enough. I know I can do hard things. It's time I learned that I don't always have to.


## No such thing as laziness {#no-such-thing-as-laziness}

The longer I have been a human, the more I am realising that there is no such thing as laziness. Laziness, this mythical sin, is supposed to grip us and make us do nothing, or just things that are not _useful_. And all that for no reason other than being lazy.

In reality, there is always something more behind what can look like laziness and procrastination from the outside. People are rarely lazy about things they like doing, find meaningful and have enough energy for. But sometimes even that isn't enough to get us going.

"If they wanted to, they would." I see this online so often, yet it's so very not true. How often I find myself desperately wanting to do something, but won't? Too many. And it's never because I'm lazy. And definitely not because I don't want to.

There is so so much that can stop us from doing something that we (or others) think we should.

There is good old fear. Fear of failure, fear of success -- both equally paralysing. There is lack of energy, plain and simple. There is feeling that the activity doesn't really hold much meaning -- pretty soul-crushing if it goes on for long. There are competing interests and duties -- what do you pick, enough sleep or finishing up a work task? Maybe the task is above our skill level and feels too daunting. Maybe we feel we don't deserve the good things that might come from it. Maybe we feel overwhelmed, not even sure what to do. Maybe we're struggling with something completely different and have no bandwidth left for even the simplest tasks. Maybe, maybe, maybe.

There is just so much that can be stopping us from doing things that will improve our life, and pretty much all of it is way more complicated and difficult than simple stupid laziness.

Let me share my personal biggest hurdles. Number one is what I call The Right Thing (TM). I learned about this one in a coaching session since years ago, when I had my first really big burnout. I answered some question that I don't remember by saying that I had to do the right thing. The psychologist repeated the question back to me: "So you have to do the right thing for yourself..." At that moment, I suddenly saw it so clearly. "No, no, no," I said quickly, "not the right thing _for me_. Just _the right thing_."

## It's not the hard that brings the results {#it-s-not-the-hard-that-brings-the-results}

In my quest to create a more sustainable life, I found "hardness" isn't what really brings the progress that people see when applying discipline, consistency and grind. The key ingredient is actually devotion to yourself. Bear with me, I will explain.

I am learning to half-ass things. I know it sounds like I'm going the wrong way here, like that one car on the highway, while online productivity and self-develpment spaces (and not only those) are full of buzz words such as discipline, willpower, consistency and grind. It took me a while to realise that _more_ discipline wasn't really what I was missing.

I used to have this idea, that you should give everything your 100%. Looking at our society, schooling system, and how much of the internet , I guess it's not so surprising.

Grind, hustle, pushing ourselves, discipline, productivity, willpower, consistency, crushing our goals. I don't know about you, but I am tired. Tired of pushing, of crushing, of powering through, of hustling and of grinding. And so I am looking for a softer, slower and gentler way of going through life.
.

I am thinking that not all processes get better when you try harder, some things simply need time and trust and consistency. This pressure on productivity and goals creates pressure on perfection too. Some of us respond to pressure with resistence, it's stressful. How do you know your goals are in accord with you if you don't slow down. Leaning into the body to know how you feel. Devotion instead of discipline. Limited amount of energy
