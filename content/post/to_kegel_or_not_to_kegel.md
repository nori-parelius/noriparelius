I remember one time when I got a chance to jump on a trampoline. I was hopping up and down with joy and careless abandon and then suddenly it dawned on me that what I was enjoying is not a given for many people. I was there, 5 months after brithing my second kid, jumping on a trampoline like there was nothing to it. To be honest, it wasn't that easy in the first year after I had my first child. But I worked on it and got better.

Do you want to know a secret? I don't do kegels.


## How the pelvic floor actually works {#how-the-pelvic-floor-actually-works}

Most people imagine the pelvic floor like some sort of a trampoline with a hole in the middle. And this holy trampoline is somehow -- miraculously -- supposed to hold all our pelvic organs. Good luck, I say.

With this image in mind, the idea of kegels does seem pretty reasonable. But only for as long as we think of the pelvic floor as a trampoline floor isolated from other structures.

Imagine a piece of fabric with a long slit in the middle. This will be our pelvic floor: it has a narrow opening that extends front to back, but isn't particularly wide.

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/kegel_tissue-floor.jpeg" alt="A picture of a tissue with a long narrow slit in it." caption="<span class=\"figure-number\">Figure 1: </span>A tissue pelvic floor with a hole for all the tubes." >}}

{{< figure src="kegel_pelvic-floor-drawing.jpeg" alt="A drawint of the pelvic floor seen from the inside, which shows all the openings being in one line from the pubic bone to the tailbone." caption="<span class=\"figure-number\">Figure 2: </span>A drawing of the pelvic floor seen from the inside. All the openings are in a line from the pubic bone to the tailbone." >}}

If we forget that the fabric is actually attached to something, the only way to keep the hole closed is to pull the edges of it together, a bit like a drawstring bag. And then hope to gods that the string holds with all its might. And that, dear reader, is a kegel.

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/kegel_tissue-kegel.jpeg" alt="A picture of the tissue with a slit and fingers trying to close the opening by pulling the edges of it together." caption="<span class=\"figure-number\">Figure 3: </span>The opening is closed by pulling in the fabric edges, like a drawstring bag or a sphincter." >}}

Now let's make our idea of the pelvic floor a bit more accurate. Let's imagine that the fabric is attached to a frame on all sides and that this frame can expand and contract a little in the front-back direction. Because, yes, there is surprisingly much movement in our pelvises and the sacrum can tilt slightly in and out.

In this case, we can close the hole by simply pulling the fabric in the front-back direction. And there you have it!

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/kegel_tissue-lenghten.jpeg" alt="A picture of the same tissue with a slit. This time, hands are pulling at the edges of a tissue, stretching it in the same direction as the slit. This shows the opening being closed." caption="<span class=\"figure-number\">Figure 4: </span>Here you go, it's enough to pull instead of scrunching and the hole is closed." >}}

You might be asking now how to pull the "fabric" of your pelvic floor in real life. Well, it's the gluteus maximus that does that -- the biggest of the glutes, the butt. It attaches to the tailbone and the sacrum from the outside, while the pelvic floor attaches from the inside. When the glutes are activated, they are pulling the tailbone outwards.

This actually happens during walking (or at least it should). It's a great way not just to close the holes, but also to train the pelvic floor. Having to resist the periodic stretching during every single step keeps it in good shape -- long, strong and elastic, just as it should be. And that's why our ancestors did ok even without a hundred kegels a day.


### The pelvic floor is not a floor {#the-pelvic-floor-is-not-a-floor}

If all of this confusion weren't enough, the pelvic floor is not actually a floor at all.

But if you try to search the web for "pelvic floor", you will find countless drawings just like this one, with the pelvic floor being horizontal and all of the organs sitting above it, magically propped up by their respective soft tubes.

{{< figure src="kegel_pelvis-drawing-wrong-eng.jpg" alt="A drawing of a side view of the pelvic area. The organs -- bladder, uterus and rectum, with their respective tubes (urethra and vagina) are perpendicular to the pelvic floor, positioned right above it." caption="<span class=\"figure-number\">Figure 5: </span>This is how people usually draw the pelvic floor -- like a holy trampoline with all the organs jumping on it." >}}

In reality, it doesn't look like that at all.

The pelvic floor attaches to the pubic bone in the front and to the tailbone and the sacrum in the back. Try to find your tailbone and your pubic bone and get them in the same horizontal plane. This is what it looks like for me. And this is not how anyone should walk around.

{{< figure src="kegel_pelvis-wrong.png" alt="A photograph of a woman's torso from the side. Hands are pointing at the pubic bone and the tailbone, which are level. The pelvis is angled like that of a pooping dog." caption="<span class=\"figure-number\">Figure 6: </span>This is what it looks like when I try to get the pubic bone and the tip of the tailbone into one horizontal level. All wrong." >}}

When you look at a pelvis oriented correctly, the pelvic floor isn't a "floor" at all. (But I will continue calling it a floor anyway, because I doubt that "pelvic wall" would catch on. Or what do you think?)

{{< figure src="kegel_pelvis-drawint-right-eng.jpg" alt="A drawing of the pelvis from the side. The organs (bladder, uterus, colon) seem to be lying on top of each other above the pubic bone, while the pelvic floor isn't horizontal, but rather diagonal." caption="<span class=\"figure-number\">Figure 7: </span>The pelvic \"floor\" is more of a pelvic \"wall\" -- the organs are lying on top of each other above the pubic bone rather than above the pelvic floor itself. They don't need to be propped up by soft tubes." >}}

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/kegel_pelvis-right.png" caption="<span class=\"figure-number\">Figure 8: </span>Here you can see where my pubic bone and tailbone are when my pelvis is in neutral." >}}

And thank gods that the pelvic floor is not a floor! All of those images of organs bouncing on a trampoline full of holes make my sphincters clench. It looks as if the uterus was proped up by the vagina and the bladder by the urethra, while these soft tubes have no chance of propping up anything. But if you orient your pelvis right, the organs can just lie there comfortably stacked on top of each other and the pubic bone. Nothing will be falling out anywhere.


## What the pelvic floor really needs {#what-the-pelvic-floor-really-needs}

What does the pelvic floor expect then? What does it need in order to work well? Well, the short version is: correct breathing and a strong butt. Read on for the long version.


### Breathing {#breathing}

The pelvic floor and the diaphragm relate to each other more than you might think. They form the walls of the same "balloon" -- the abdominopelvic cavity. The diapraghm is the ceiling and the pelvic floor is the floor/back wall. When the diapraghm depresses during an inhale, it increases the pressure in the cavity. The pelvic floor feels the pressure and has to activate to resist it.

If we don't breathe properly, problems show up. So breathing well is a surprising, but important step towards a healthy pelvic floor.
You can read more about breathing !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!


### Butt {#butt}

As I mentioned before, the butt and the pelvic floor are partners that work together and workout together. Unfortunately, many aspects of our lives aren't very nice to our butts.


### Sitting {#sitting}

One of the worst modern habits is the almost constant sitting in the same position. Most of the contraptions we sit in almost don't allow another way of sitting. We sit leaning back, lower back rounded, pelvis tucked under -- literally sitting on our tailbones and pushing them inwards. This is putting the pelvic floor in a shortened position, which means it has trouble closing anything. It has to adapt to this, so it shortens over time too and becomes tighter and tighter.

The take-away message here is -- don't sit on your tailbone. If you want to read more about sitting, you can check out my post about sitting. !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!


### Standing {#standing}

Unfortunately, when we finally stand up from our lounging position, not all of our body parts stand up with us. No, this is not a ghost story, I'm just trying to say that too much sitting changes how our body works to the point that we aren't even able to stand right anymore.

Sitting, and especially if done in high heels (by which I mean anything higher than 0), leads to shortening of muscles on the back of the legs. It's a shortening that doesn't just go away when we stand up. Give them enough time in a seated position and they literally rebuild themselves.

As a result, most of us stand with our pelvis tucked under and often shoved forward as well. In this position, the muscles on the back of the legs are in their familiar short position.

Unfortunately, tucked pelvis is not good news.

When the pelvis is tucked, the butt can't work. The insertions of the muscles are in a position where they can't pull anything anywhere. This seriously compromises the stability of the pelvis, the efficiency of the gait and yes, the tug-of-war between the butt and the pelvic floor. The pelvic floor loses its partner.

To top it off, tucking the pelvis makes the pelvic floor into an actual horizontal floor, so now it has to carry more of the weight of the organs above. To keep everything in, it has to clench. And hold. And hold. But if the butt isn't pulling from the other side, the pelvic floor just ends up dragging the tailbone inward. And so its own frame is getting smaller and it has to get smaller with it. Clench and hold.

The poor pelvic floor is clenching, shortening and holding with all its might, but muscle contractions become less and less effective as the muscle is shortened. (It has to do with the overlapp of the fibers in them, but that is a topic for another day.) The overworked pelvic floor becomes stiff and we finally start noticing the trouble -- pain, incontinence, prolapse.

And that's why a tucked pelvis is a disaster for the pelvic floor.


### Why not kegels {#why-not-kegels}

The pelvic floor is supposed to be strong and supple. It needs to react to breathing, pull of other muscles around and changes in the pressure in the abdominopelvic cavity.

Due to our modern lives, most of us are using our pelvic floor wrong. We turn it into a "floor" by tucking the pelvis and we don't let it play with its friends -- the butt and the diaphragm. We end up with a pelvic floor that is shortened, stiff and overworked. As a result, it can't contract as it should, so we _think_ it's _weak_.

Unfortunately, what kind of advice will the owner of this poor pelvic floor get? In 99/100 cases, that would be kegels. And what do kegels do? Assuming a weak pelvic floor, a kegel is supposed to make it stronger by regular contractions.

And so the chronicly contracted, shortened, stiff and overworked pelvic floor gets a regular regime of _more_ contracting and shortening. Because a kegel is just like tightening the string on a drawstring bag -- it completely misses the actual problem most people have.

It usually works for a while. Training will increase the strength of the pelvic floor, so it becomes better able to work in these horrible conditions. The symptoms will improve temporarily, but are likely to come back, because the real problem is only getting worse.

Plus, let's be honest, kegels are a funny one. Why should we even need such a strange exercise? For most issues, functional exercises tend to provide the most benefit. The kind of movement that make sense in context: in daily life or sports. Just because we strenghten a muscle using an isolated exercise, doesn't mean it will activate when it should in real life. Movement is as much about the brain as it is about muscles.


### When kegels are the right solution {#when-kegels-are-the-right-solution}

Some people might benefit from kegels, if their pelvic floor is actually weak. Although, even in this case, the kegels should be paired with other exercises and lifestyle changes.

Kegels can also help us to "get to know" our pelvic floor muscles and learn to activate them. For this purpose, the quality of the exercise matters much more than the quantity. And most people are doing kegels wrong: using either the wrong muscles, or focusing only on the contraction, while the release is at least equally important.

If you believe kegels might be the right thing for you, I encourage you to find a good pelvic floor physiotherapist who can make sure that it really is what you need and that you do them right.


### If not kegels, then what? {#if-not-kegels-then-what}

Pelvic floor dysfunction is one of our floppy fins. Just like orcas in captivity often end up with a bent-over dorsal fin, humans in the modern world often end up with pelvic floor issues. The reason is the same, lack of the mechanical inputs that our bodies evolved with, rely on and take for granted. (You can read more about floppy fins here !!!!!!!!!!!!!)

How can we get a healthy, supple and strong pelvic floor without kegels?

You already have a part of the answer. It's good breathing, sitting and standing (especially the position of the pelvis, which I wrote about more here as well !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!)

Good posture puts the pelvic floor in a position where it can work. The next step is to give it enought opportunities to do just that.

Walking and squatting are among the best movements that optimally engage the pelvic floor. They both involve the whole body and have been ubiquitous in the lives of our ancestors for millions of years. When we lack either or both, we begin hurting in many different places, but the pelvic floor is one of the first victims.

I wrote more about the basic movements that we are missing here !!!!!!!!!!!

So how is your relationship with kegels? You can let me know if you feel like it.
