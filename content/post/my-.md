You know that feeling when you are thirteen and you read a book, or see a movie and feel like it changes everything? Like it shakes your whole world down to its core and makes it settle down completely new? Like you emerge on the other side a different person, and you just want to tell everyone about it?

These experiences become more and more rare as we get older, but I had one recently. It was brought on by a trilogy of books by Daniel Quinn, _Ishmael_, _The Story of B_ and _My Ishmael_.
