When I was young, I used to think of farming as boring. Totally uninteresting, kinda dumb, even. Oh, how I cringe, embarrased, when I think about that old and dumb me. Now I know better. Because when you really, really think about it, farming is one of the most important things anyone could ever do. And it seems we got it pretty wrong.


## One of those books that change your life {#one-of-those-books-that-change-your-life}

Thanks to the book club I am participating in (video about our book club), I have been reading a lot about agriculture lately. The question of how we can feed the world without overwhelming our plantet's resources is a big and important one. And definitely not simple.

I can see a red thread going through the books I have read so far, one I keep coming back to. One that also has its origins in a book. You know that feeling when you are thirteen and you read a book, or see a movie and feel like it changes everything? Like it shakes your whole world down to its core and makes it settle down completely new? Like you emerge on the other side a different person, and you just want to tell everyone about it?

These experiences become more and more rare as we get older, but I had one recently. It was brought on by a trilogy of books by Daniel Quinn, _Ishmael_, _The Story of B_ and _My Ishmael_.

The Ishmael trilogy are novels, but they are more philosophy than story (although they do all tell a good story). They were written in mid to late nineties and they are only becoming more relevant with time.

What are they about? Well, to put it shortly, they are about what is wrong with the world.


## Is humanity inherently flawed? {#is-humanity-inherently-flawed}

I don't know about you, but I often feel like there is something wrong with our world. That it should work somehow differently, that we lost something somewhere, or lost ourselves on the way. And especially in the last few decades, there are probably more and more people who feel that way. Sometimes it feels like too much to think about: loss of species at an incredible rate, harmful forever chemicals in everthing and everyone, pollution, climate change, crime, wars, mental health crisis, poverty, ...

As Quinn points out, if you asked schoolchildren about what is wrong with the world, they would probably give you roughly the same answers as the Unabomber. Something along the line of out-of-control technological advancement, out-of-control corporate and industrial greed, and out-of-control governmet expansion etc.

We feel like there is something inherently wrong with humanity, something that makes us mess up no matter how hard we try. We have accepted it as some sort of a curse, having to watch our good intentions turn sour results, but Quinn in his trilogy points out one fact that we all seem to forget.

> Humans have lived on this planet for 3 million years in perfect harmony with the rest of the world.

Just think about that for a bit. 3 million years. That is a hell of a long time. Our civilisation started just some 12 000 years ago. At best. Which means it has been around only for 0.4% of the human history. I know what you are thinking. They weren't _quite_ people, were they? Well, fair enough, 3 million years ago we started out as Homo habilis. They were similar enough to us that they got the name Homo, but they weren't quite us yet. But Homo sapiens -- people genetically, anatomically and physiologically identical to us -- have been around for 300 000 years. Our civilisation accounts only for the last 4% of that time.

We like to think about the time before the birth of our culture as the "prehistory". As if it were a long run-up, when people weren't yet people, like they were not finished. To us it seems like they weren't doing much, because they weren't trying to conquer the world. And while they didn't have opera houses, central heating or quantum physics, most of modern humans don't have those luxuries either. They had something else though. From what we know, they had healthy and happy lives.


## Takers and Leavers {#takers-and-leavers}

Humans are clearly capable of living peacefully in and with the world. Where is the problem then? Why does it seem so difficult for us? The answer lies in who we believe ourselves to be -- in our culture. And when I say _our culture_, I mean basically almost all of us. There are a few people left in the world that are not of our culture, but there aren't many. They live on the fringes of what we like to call "civilisation". Our culture has spread across the whole world and devoured all the others.

We have no good name for our culture, because we never needed it. To us, it's just... _us_. So I will gladly use the name that Ishmael gave our culture in Quinn's books: we are the Takers. And all the other cultures are Leaver cultures.

Our culture grew at the expense of the others, because of a perfect storm of our believes, of our mythology. The truth is, we believe that the world was made for us, and that it is our place to rule it. We rarely say it out loud, but we think of ourselves as the pinnacle of evolution, of what it all was meant to lead to. We believe our destiny is to take this world that was given to us and conquer it. To make it what _we_ want it to be.


## Totalitarian agriculture {#totalitarian-agriculture}

What do I want to say.
I want to say that we were not always destroying things. That our culture is what is strange here and that it started with the agriculture. but not any agriculture, but totalitarian agriculture. That we believe we know better and we can do what we want, but we also believe that we are alone in it, and have to constantly fight. I want to talk about how Will Harris saw it too, how he talked about killing everything
I want to talk about how resilience can't be optimized, and how we need to save farming.

In the first Matrix movie, agent Smith calls humanity a virus that multiplies until every natural resource is consumed. He calls us a disease, a cancer of the planet, a plague. Agent Smith is also a psychopathic villain, so such opinions very much suit him. But I see the same sentiment reflected all around me. We seem to collectively feel like there is something inherently wrong with humanity, something that makes us mess up no matter how hard we try. We have accepted it as some sort of a curse; having to watch our good intentions turn into sour results. We think that the best we can do for the world, for nature, is to stay away. But what if we got that wrong?

You know that feeling when you are thirteen and you read a book, or see a movie and feel like it changes everything? Like it shakes your whole world down to its core and makes it settle down completely new? Like you emerge on the other side a different person, and you just want to tell everyone about it?

The Ishmael trilogy are novels, but they are more philosophy than story (although they do all tell a good story). They were written in mid to late nineties and they are only becoming more relevant with time.

I have noticed ideas from Ishmael in many of the non-fiction books I have been reading lately. Common themes shining through like a red thread, connecting the real-world challenges and experiences to the philosophy of Ishmael, hinting at roots and at solutions.

One of the biggest themes of Ishmael is that _we_ are not humanity, and that is a good thing.


## The culture of the agricultural revolution {#the-culture-of-the-agricultural-revolution}

We -- you and me and every other member of our culture -- are definitely human, but we are not the only ones. When I say "our culture" in this case, I mean all of us that live in "civilisation", be it East or West, developped or developping. There are only a handful of peoples left that do not belong to our culture.

For a long time, we thought humans came into this world as us -- city-builders and agriculturalists -- and it wasn't until about the 18th century that we have started learning about our long hunter-gatherer past. While this might be old news for people nowadays, we seem to be underappreciating what this actually means.

Whether you look for the beginnings of our genus Homo, which was 3 million years ago, or for the beginnings of the modern humans, which was 300 000 years ago, humans have been here for a very, very long time, before our culture appeared.
