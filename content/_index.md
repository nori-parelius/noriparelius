If we shrank the lifetime of our species into one hour, we would still have been hunters and gatherers two minutes ago.

We have the bodies and the minds of our ancient ancestors, while living in this exciting, wonderful, confusing, modern, human zoo.

I can't be the only one who finds it a bit tricky sometimes, I think.

This personal blog is about the things I think about, learn about, try and test, in my attempts to get better at being human.

## Hi, I'm Nori {#hi-i-m-nori}

I am and always have been a scientist at heart. And a nerd with a hint of neurodivergence.

I like to dive into various topics, dig in the research, test things and learn. And rant. Oh, ranting is probably my favourite hobby. And I lowkey want to save the world.

I have a PhD in biophysics, although my current day job is in data analysis. Iâ€™m also a movement enthusiast and a corrective exercise specialist.

I am an expat from Slovakia living in Norway with my Viking husband and two little wildlings.


## Don't look for me on social media {#don-t-look-for-me-on-social-media}

I have more or less quit social media, so if you want to be notified next time I post something, feel free to  [sign up for the newsletter](https://dashboard.mailerlite.com/forms/370167/82934069710554625/share). There is also an RSS feed link in the website footer, if that is more your thing.
