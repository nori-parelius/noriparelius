If we shrank the lifetime of our species into one hour, we would still have been hunters and gatherers two minutes ago.

We have the bodies and the minds of our ancient ancestors, while living in this exciting, wonderful, confusing, modern, human zoo.

I can't be the only one who finds it a bit tricky sometimes, I think.

This personal blog is about the things I think about, learn about, try and test, in my attempts to get better at being human.

## Hi, I'm Nori {#hi-i-m-nori}

I am and always have been a scientist at heart. And a nerd with a hint of the 'tism.

I like to dive into various topics, dig in the research, test things and learn. And rant. Oh, ranting is probably my favourite hobby. And I lowkey want to save the world.

I have a PhD in biophysics, although my current day job is in data analysis.

I am from Slovakia, now living in Norway with my Viking husband and two little wildlings.


## I'm not much about social media {#i-m-not-much-about-social-media}

Whatever I post here goes also on some social media, but if you want to be reliably notified the next time I post something, and prefer reading without ads or anyone tracking you, I recommend to sign up for the newsletter. No spam, just letting you know when I write, at most once a week, but most likely much (much) less often than that. There is also an RSS feed, if that is more your thing.
