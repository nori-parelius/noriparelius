## Who I am {#who-i-am}

Hi, my name is Eleonora (Nori) Parelius and this is my website: <https://noriparelius.com>. You can contact me through email at nori@noriparelius.com. I care about your privacy and protecting any data you might trust me with.


## Cookies {#cookies}

This website is a static website and it uses no cookies on its own.

I also don't use any analytics, which means I am not tracking any of your visits (and also have no idea how many people are actually reading my blog).


### Embedded content from other websites {#embedded-content-from-other-websites}

Even though I am not setting any cookies, articles on this site may include embedded content such as YouTube videos. If you interact with this content (for example click play on a video) it behaves as if you were visiting the website where the content is from. This I have no control over.

These websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional third-party tracking, and monitor your interaction with that embedded content, including tracking your interaction with the embedded content if you have an account and are logged in to that website.


## Email newsletter {#email-newsletter}

If you decide to sign up for my email newsletter by entering your email into the sign-up form, I will store your email address. This I need in order to be able to send you the newsletter that you signed up for. For this email service I am using [MailerLite](https://www.mailerlite.com). They also keep track for me of whether you open the email and click on any links in it.

You can unsubscribe from the newsletter at any time by clicking a link in one of the emails, or by sending me an email to nori@noriparelius.com letting me know you want to unsubscribe.


## Your rights with respect to personal data {#your-rights-with-respect-to-personal-data}

According to the law, you have the following rights with respect to your personal data:

-   You have the right to know why your personal data is needed, what will happen to it, and how long it will be retained for.
-   Right of access: You have the right to access your personal data that is known to me.
-   Right to rectification: you have the right to supplement, correct, have deleted or blocked your personal data whenever you wish.

-   Right to transfer your data: you have the right to request all your personal data from the controller and transfer it in its entirety to another controller.
-   Right to object: you may object to the processing of your data. I comply with this, unless there are justified grounds for processing.
