If we shrank the lifetime of our species into one hour, we would still have been hunters and gatherers two minutes ago.

We have the bodies and the minds of our ancient ancestors, while living in this exciting, wonderful, confusing, modern, human zoo. 

I can't be the only one who finds it a bit tricky sometimes, I think.

This personal blog is about the things I think about, learn about, try and test, in my attempts to get better at being human.

My knee problems started when I was about 12. I would feel sharp pain deep in my joints when I was skiing, running and at times when it was worst, even walking.

The doctors told me to just say good bye to skiing, because there was nothing to do. Probably worn cartilages, that was the verdict. At 12 years old! I was not the most active child, so that didn't quite compute, but I was chubby by the 90s and early 2000s standards, which was quite enough a reason.

I was pretty stricken, as any 12 year old facing their mortality like that probably would be. Pretty melodramatic too. I thought that was it, that it would only go downhill from there. But, a decde and half later the things started going very much uphill and I actually fixed my knee problems! 
Moje problémy s kolenami začali, keď som mala asi 12 rokov. Cítila som v nich ostrú, bodavú bolesť pri lyžovaní, behaní, a v obdobiach, keď to bolo najhoršie, dokonca aj pri chôdzi.

Lekár mi vtedy povedal, že mám opotrebované chrupavky, že s tým už nič, a že teda nemám lyžovať. Opotrebované chrupavky. V dvanástich rokoch! Ak by som sa venovala vrcholovým športom, možno, ale ja som bola úplne normálne, skôr pokojné dieťa, bez akýchkoľvek športových ambícií.

Pamätám si, ako ma to vtedy zasiahlo. Prvýkrát v živote mi bolo niečo, čo sa nedalo opraviť. Zaplavil ma pocit smrteľnosti. (Človek vie byť dosť melodramatický v dvanástich.) V každom prípade, som si myslela, že už to so mnou pôjde iba dole vodou. Na moje šťastie to o 15 rokov začalo ísť hore vodou, a ja som svoje problémy s kolenami vyliečila. A preto tento článok bude o chodidlách.

Chodidlá – základ človeka

Čo majú chodidlá spoločné s kolenami? Veľmi veľa. Tak ako majú veľmi veľa spoločné s bedrovými kĺbami, zadkom, chrbtom aj krkom. Chodidlá nesú celú našu váhu. Pri chôdzi a behu dokonca sila, ktorou dopadáme na zem zodpovedá niekoľkonásobku našej váhy. Až keď som pozorovala svoju malú dcéru, ako sa učí chodiť, uvedomila som si, aké je neuveriteľné, že dokážeme bez námahy balansovať celé naše dlhé telá na takej malej ploche.

Nohy sú ako základy domu. Ak sú krivé, a nakláňa sa nám kvôli nim strecha, je zbytočné opravovať strechu. Aj keď chodidlá nie sú možno najcoolovejšia téma, je to základ, a preto z tohto asi urobím sériu. A začneme s tým, prečo by sme nemali chodiť s nohami smerujúcimi do strán.
Prečo by chodidlá mali smerovať dopredu

Poobzerajte sa okolo seba (a nezabudnite sa poobzerať aj pod seba, na svoje nohy) a určite si všimnete, že veľa ľudí chodí s nohami (alebo len jednou) trochu (alebo veľmi) vytočenými do strán. Prsty im nesmerujú dopredu, ale šikmo do strán. Zopár stupňov, 5-10, nie je ešte problém, ale viac než to môže mať ďalekosiahle následky. Tak si to rozoberme postupne po častiach tela, od dola hore.
Chodidlá a členky
Plochá noha

Státím s nohami do strán nám spadne klenba. Povedal vám lekár, že máte ploché nohy? Môže to byť “skutočná” plochá noha, často následkom zranenia, alebo to môže byť spôsobené len tým, ako ju používate.

Naša klenba nie je vytesaná z kameňa tak ako tá na kostole. Je skôr ako pružina zo svalov a šliach. Keď chodíme s nohami smerujúcimi von, klenba spadne a prestane pružiť. Za normálnych okolností noha dokáže absorbovať energiu z dopadu chodidla na zem práve vďaka klenbe, ale pri plochej nohe sa tieto nárazy prenášajú vyššie, ku kolenám, bedrovým kĺbom a chrbtu. A ani topánky s hrubou podrážkou, bublinami, alebo pružinami to celkom nevyriešia.

Okrem toho, plochá noha namáha šľachy, ktoré by mali v spolupráci so svalmi klenbu držať. Na ich smolu totiž v tomto prípade svaly pracujú proti nim. Na spodku nohy sa nachádza plochá šľacha, ktorá sa volá plantárna aponeuróza, a ktorá spája prsty s pätou. Je natiahnutá medzi nimi ako taká gumička a pomáha zachovať klenbu. Pri plochých nohách je táto šľacha natiahnutá. Ak ju naťahujeme príliš, môže začať bolieť.

Nestabilný členok

Ďalšia skupina šliach pomáha stabilizovať a spevniť členok. Keď je chodidlo otočené smerom von v porovnaní s predkolením, šľachy na vonkajšej strane členka sú v uvoľnenej polohe. Je to preto, že kosti, ktoré spájajú, sú príliš blízko pri sebe a šľachy sa na rozdiel od svalov nevedia stiahnuť. Členok stráca stabilitu a je ľahšie si ho vyvrtnúť.
Vbočené palce

Vbočené palce, alebo takzvané haluxy, vedia byť celkom problém, a možno o nich niekedy napíšem celý článok. Veľmi často sú dôsledkom nosenia tesných topánok, ktoré stláčajú prsty k sebe, až tie prsty tak ostanú. Sú však aj ľudia, ktorí nosia viac-menej pohodlné topánky, a aj tak skončia s vybočenými palcami. Úzke topánky totiž nie sú jediným možným dôvodom ich vzniku.

Pri chôdzi by sa váha mala presúvať od päty k prstom pozdĺž osi chodidla. To znamená, že počas kroku sa chodidlo ohne pod prstami a tým veľkým kĺbom na báze palca a palcom samotným sa môžeme odtlačiť od zeme. Ale teraz si predstavte, že chodidlá smerujú do strany, lenže my chceme ísť samozrejme dopredu. Miesto toho, aby sme váhu preniesli pozdĺž palca, prevalíme ju cez jeho stranu a zatláčame ho každým krokom k ostatným prstom. A tadá, vbočené palce aj bez úzkych topánok.

Kolená

Posuňme sa teraz trochu vyššie, ku kolenám. Noha, ktorá je vytočená do strany, väčšinou vedie k určitej rotácii aj v úrovni kolena. Kolenné väzy sú potom príliš natiahnuté, alebo práve uvoľnené, podľa toho, či sú ich konce zrazu neobvykle ďaleko, alebo blízko pri sebe. Na rozdiel od svalov, väzy a šľachy sa nevedia sťahovať, a na ich optimálnu funkciu je naozaj dôležité, aby vzájomná poloha kostí, ktoré spájajú, bola správna.

Pri vytočených chodidlách sú väzy na vonkajšej strane kolena a krížené väzy vo vnútri kolena uvoľnené a koleno stráca stabilitu. Koleno sa často potom prepadáva smerom dovnútra a nohy vyzerajú, že sú do X. Teda vlastne, nie len vyzerajú, ale sú.
Väzy na vnútornej strane sú potom príliš natiahnuté a pod stresom. (To bol aj môj prípad po dlhé roky.)
Bedrá

Teraz už sa od chodidiel dostávame poriadne ďaleko. Na úrovni bedrových kĺbov takéto vytočenie chodidiel znamená, že je ťažké zapojiť svaly zadku. Jednou z ich úloh je vytáčať stehennú kosť do vonka. Ak je stehno už vytočené, sval je v skrátenej polohe a nemá sa ako viac sťahovať, takže nič veľmi nerobí. Vtedy neplní ani svoju druhú úlohu, čo je odťahovanie nohy do strany. Možno by ste povedali, že to je pohyb, ktorý nepraktizujete často, ale pravdepodobne by ste sa mýlili. Tento pohyb je totiž potrebný pri chôdzi. Bez zapojenia svalov zadku sa nám potom kolená ešte viac stretávajú v strede a ešte viac sa opotrebovávajú.

Okrem kolien takýto lenivý zadok ovplyvňuje aj panvové dno a krížovú chrbticu. Kríže musia za neho kompenzovať a vieme, aké sú bolesti krížov časté. Panvové dno zasa oslabne a stuhne, lebo zadok funguje ako jeho partner. Svaly zadku aj panvového dna sa pripájajú na kostrč, zadok ju ťahá smerom dozadu a panvové dno dopredu. Keď zadok prestane ťahať, a keď si ešte k tomu často sedíme na kostrči, táto sa zatláča dnu a panvové dno sa skráti a slabne.

A to všetko len kvôli tomu, že stojíme s nohami do strán! Samozrejme, nie všetko sa u každého prejaví a nie hneď. Záleží aj na tom, ako veľmi sú chodidlá vytočené a kde presne sa to deje, či na úrovni bedrových kĺbov, kolien, členkov, alebo všade trošku.
Prečo tak veľa ľudí stojí s vytočenými nohami

V niektorých prípadoch sú do strany smerujúce nohy vrodené, ale to je veľmi zriedkavé. U maličkých detí je to normálne, lebo kĺby sa im ešte vyvíjajú. Väčšina dospelých to má však kvôli zvyku a tomu, ako svoje telá používame.
Len zvyk

Päty k sebe, špičky od seba je postoj, ktorý sa učil na telesnej výchove, na povinnej vojenskej službe, aj na balete. A pohyby, ktorým venujeme pozornosť začneme nakoniec používať aj v čase, keď nedávame pozor. Preto baletky chodia ako baletky aj keď nebaletia.

Navyše, od detstva okolo seba vidíme ľudí, ktorí chodia určitým spôsobom, a bez toho, aby sme si to uvedomili, sa náš pohyb učíme od nich. (Takže vaše “geneticky” zlé kolená, vbočené palce, či boľavý chrbát nemusia vôbec byť genetické, aj keď ich má celá rodina. Možno sa všetci iba rovnako hýbete.)
Topánky a sedenie

Ak by to nebolo dosť, sú tu aj ďalšie faktory, ktoré nás vedú k tomu, že vytáčame nohy do strán. Jedným z dôvodov môžu byť skrátené lýtkové svaly. Ak sú lýtkové svaly krátke, nevieme poriadne ohnúť členok a priblížiť prsty k píšťale (poznáte špička-fajka? tak fajka). Bez dostatočnej pohyblivosti členka je chôdza problém. Ak ale vytočíme chodidlá von, členok sa nepotrebuje toľko ohýbať a vieme nejako kráčať. A naše telá sa snažia splniť naše požiadavky na pohyb, aj keď im to dlhodobo môže ublížiť. Takže obetujú správne postavenie kĺbov, aby sme sa boli schopní hýbať. Lebo čo ak by nás naháňal medveď.

Ako sa nám môžu skrátiť lýtkové svaly? Nuž ľahko. Sedením a nosením topánok s podpätkom (nie len vysokým, aj “normálnym”). Pri nich sú totiž lýtkové svaly v skrátenej polohe, a keď tak trávia veľa času, potom také ostanú.

Ďalším problémom je nosenie tesných topánok, ktoré stláčajú prsty k sebe. Tým sa zmenšuje plocha, na ktorej stojíme, čiže strácame stabilitu. Stlačené prsty sa k tomu horšie hýbu a aj to zhoršuje stabilitu. Ako kompenzáciu často vytočíme nohu von, čo zväčšuje plochu, na ktorej stojíme. Klenba sa zníži a dotyková plocha so zemou je väčšia.

Ako si vyrovnať nohy

Dobrá správa je, že riešenie je vcelku jednoduché. Keďže vo väčšine prípadov je chodenie s nohami von zvyk, ide len o to zvyknúť si chodiť rovno. Nezaberá to žiaden extra čas, treba sa len sústrediť na to, ako sedíme, stojíme a chodíme.
Chodidlá paralelne

Postavte sa, a skúste nájsť na zemi dve paralelné čiary (dlaždičky, okraj koberca, skrine, knihy… Aj vy máte knihy na zemi?). Potom si vyrovnajte chodidlá tak, aby osi chodidiel (od päty ku začiatku ukazováka) boli paralelne. Neriaďte sa vnútornou hranou nohy. Ak sú tie paralelne, nohy sú vytočené do vonka. Riadte sa buď osou nohy, alebo vonkajšou hranou.

Čudné? Ja viem. Ja som si na začiatku myslela, že stratím rovnováhu. Ak je vám to veľmi nepríjemné, nemusíte to úplne vyrovnať naraz, stačí postupne. Je to len otázka zvyku. Čím viac pozornosti, a čím častejšie, tomu budete venovať, tým skôr si zvyknete a budete tak chodiť bez rozmýšľania.
Kolená dopredu

Keď už máte chodidlá vyrovnané, pozrite sa na kolená. Smerujú priamo dopredu, alebo k sebe? Ak si nie ste istí, skúste niekoho poprosiť, aby sa vám zozadu pozrel na kolenné jamky. Tie by mali smerovať priamo dozadu. Ak nesmerujú, skúste vytočiť stehenné kosti do vonka, bez toho aby ste zdvihli chodidlo. V prípade, že vám nejde nasmerovať koleno dopredu, budete musieť chodidlá vyrovnávať postupne, lebo nechceme opraviť chodidlo a pri tom pokaziť koleno. Takže vyrovnávajte len koľko sa dá.
Natiahnuť lýtkové svaly

Takmer každý dnes má skrátené lýtkové svaly, takže aby vás neobmedzovali, zaraďte do svojho dňa tento cvik.
Správne topánky

Nesmieme zabudnúť na topánky. Topánky by mali mať dostatočne širokú špičku, aby prsty mali dosť pohyblivosti, a aby celá noha bola dosť stabilná. V topánke by ste mali byť schopní prsty roztiahnuť. Na začiatok môže byť dobrá pomôcka obkresliť si bosú nohu s roztiahnutými prstami na papier a topánku na ňu postaviť. Ak noha pretŕča, topánka je určite príliš úzka. Schválne, otestujte si topánky, čo máte doma.

Keď už sme pri topánkach, pomôže aj nosiť topánky bez opätku, kvôli ktorým sa nám nebudú skracovať lýtkové svaly. O topánkach sa dá rozprávať strašne veľa, ale to niekedy nabudúce, lebo tento článok začína byť trochu dlhý. (Hurá, ten čas nakoniec prišiel a celý článok o topánkach nájdete tu.)
Na záver

Ak vás tento článok presvedčil, že nechcete chodiť s nohami na krivo, aby ste si ušetrili problémy s chodidlami, členkami, kolenami, bedrovými kĺbami, chrbtom a panvovým dnom (uf, ale toho je), tak tu je malá rekapitulácia, čo s tým.

I remember one time when I got a chance to jump on a trampoline. I was hopping up and down with joy and careless abandon and then suddenly it dawned on me that what I was enjoying is not a given for many people. I was there, 5 months after brithing my second kid, jumping on a trampoline like there was nothing to it. To be honest, it wasn't that easy in the first year after I had my first child. But I worked on it and got better.

Do you want to know a secret? I don't do kegels.

*** How the pelvic floor actually works
Most people imagine the pelvic floor like some sort of a trampoline with a hole in the middle. And this holy trampoline is somehow -- miraculously -- supposed to hold all our pelvic organs. Good luck, I say.

With this image in mind, the idea of kegels does seem pretty reasonable. But only for as long as we think of the pelvic floor as a trampoline floor isolated from other structures. 

Imagine a piece of fabric with a long slit in the middle. This will be our pelvic floor: it has a narrow opening that extends front to back, but isn't particularly wide.

#+attr_html: :alt A picture of a tissue with a long narrow slit in it.
#+caption: A tissue pelvic floor with a hole for all the tubes.

#+attr_html: :alt A drawint of the pelvic floor seen from the inside, which shows all the openings being in one line from the pubic bone to the tailbone.  
#+caption: A drawing of the pelvic floor seen from the inside. All the openings are in a line from the pubic bone to the tailbone.
[[file:kegel_pelvic-floor-drawing.jpeg]]

If we forget that the fabric is actually attached to something, the only way to keep the hole closed is to pull the edges of it together, a bit like a drawstring bag. And then hope to gods that the string holds with all its might. And that, dear reader, is a kegel.

#+attr_html: :alt A picture of the tissue with a slit and fingers trying to close the opening by pulling the edges of it together. 
#+caption: The opening is closed by pulling in the fabric edges, like a drawstring bag or a sphincter.
[[file:kegel_tissue-kegel.jpeg]]

Now let's make our idea of the pelvic floor a bit more accurate. Let's imagine that the fabric is attached to a frame on all sides and that this frame can expand and contract a little in the front-back direction. Because, yes, there is surprisingly much movement in our pelvises and the sacrum can tilt slightly in and out.

In this case, we can close the hole by simply pulling the fabric in the front-back direction. And there you have it!

#+attr_html: :alt A picture of the same tissue with a slit. This time, hands are pulling at the edges of a tissue, stretching it in the same direction as the slit. This shows the opening being closed. 
#+caption: Here you go, it's enough to pull instead of scrunching and the hole is closed.
[[file:kegel_tissue-lenghten.jpeg]]

You might be asking now how to pull the "fabric" of your pelvic floor in real life. Well, it's the gluteus maximus that does that -- the biggest of the glutes, the butt. It attaches to the tailbone and the sacrum from the outside, while the pelvic floor attaches from the inside. When the glutes are activated, they are pulling the tailbone outwards.

This actually happens during walking (or at least it should). It's a great way not just to close the holes, but also to train the pelvic floor. Having to resist the periodic stretching during every single step keeps it in good shape -- long, strong and elastic, just as it should be. And that's why our ancestors did ok even without a hundred kegels a day.

**** The pelvic floor is not a floor
If all of this confusion weren't enough, the pelvic floor is not actually a floor at all.

But if you try to search the web for "pelvic floor", you will find countless drawings just like this one, with the pelvic floor being horizontal and all of the organs sitting above it, magically propped up by their respective soft tubes.

#+attr_html: :alt A drawing of a side view of the pelvic area. The organs -- bladder, uterus and rectum, with their respective tubes (urethra and vagina) are perpendicular to the pelvic floor, positioned right above it. 
#+caption: This is how people usually draw the pelvic floor -- like a holy trampoline with all the organs jumping on it.
[[file:kegel_pelvis-drawing-wrong-eng.jpg]]

In reality, it doesn't look like that at all.

The pelvic floor attaches to the pubic bone in the front and to the tailbone and the sacrum in the back. Try to find your tailbone and your pubic bone and get them in the same horizontal plane. This is what it looks like for me. And this is not how anyone should walk around.

#+attr_html: :alt A photograph of a woman's torso from the side. Hands are pointing at the pubic bone and the tailbone, which are level. The pelvis is angled like that of a pooping dog. 
#+caption: This is what it looks like when I try to get the pubic bone and the tip of the tailbone into one horizontal level. All wrong.
[[file:kegel_pelvis-wrong.png]]

When you look at a pelvis oriented correctly, the pelvic floor isn't a "floor" at all. (But I will continue calling it a floor anyway, because I doubt that "pelvic wall" would catch on. Or what do you think?)

#+attr_html: :alt A drawing of the pelvis from the side. The organs (bladder, uterus, colon) seem to be lying on top of each other above the pubic bone, while the pelvic floor isn't horizontal, but rather diagonal. 
#+caption: The pelvic "floor" is more of a pelvic "wall" -- the organs are lying on top of each other above the pubic bone rather than above the pelvic floor itself. They don't need to be propped up by soft tubes.

#+attr_html :alt A photo of a woman's torso from the side, hands pointing at the pubic bone and tailbone, where the pubic bone is lower than the tailbone. The silhouette looks natural.
#+caption: Here you can see where my pubic bone and tailbone are when my pelvis is in neutral.
[[file:kegel_pelvis-right.png]]

And thank gods that the pelvic floor is not a floor! All of those images of organs bouncing on a trampoline full of holes make my sphincters clench. It looks as if the uterus was proped up by the vagina and the bladder by the urethra, while these soft tubes have no chance of propping up anything. But if you orient your pelvis right, the organs can just lie there comfortably stacked on top of each other and the pubic bone. Nothing will be falling out anywhere.

*** What the pelvic floor really needs
What does the pelvic floor expect then? What does it need in order to work well? Well, the short version is: correct breathing and a strong butt. Read on for the long version.

**** Breathing
The pelvic floor and the diaphragm relate to each other more than you might think. They form the walls of the same "balloon" -- the abdominopelvic cavity. The diapraghm is the ceiling and the pelvic floor is the floor/back wall. When the diapraghm depresses during an inhale, it increases the pressure in the cavity. The pelvic floor feels the pressure and has to activate to resist it.

If we don't breathe properly, problems show up. So breathing well is a surprising, but important step towards a healthy pelvic floor.
You can read more about breathing !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

**** Butt
As I mentioned before, the butt and the pelvic floor are partners that work together and workout together. Unfortunately, many aspects of our lives aren't very nice to our butts.

**** Sitting
One of the worst modern habits is the almost constant sitting in the same position. Most of the contraptions we sit in almost don't allow another way of sitting. We sit leaning back, lower back rounded, pelvis tucked under -- literally sitting on our tailbones and pushing them inwards. This is putting the pelvic floor in a shortened position, which means it has trouble closing anything. It has to adapt to this, so it shortens over time too and becomes tighter and tighter.

The take-away message here is -- don't sit on your tailbone. If you want to read more about sitting, you can check out my post about sitting. !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

**** Standing
Unfortunately, when we finally stand up from our lounging position, not all of our body parts stand up with us. No, this is not a ghost story, I'm just trying to say that too much sitting changes how our body works to the point that we aren't even able to stand right anymore.

Sitting, and especially if done in high heels (by which I mean anything higher than 0), leads to shortening of muscles on the back of the legs. It's a shortening that doesn't just go away when we stand up. Give them enough time in a seated position and they literally rebuild themselves.

As a result, most of us stand with our pelvis tucked under and often shoved forward as well. In this position, the muscles on the back of the legs are in their familiar short position.

Unfortunately, tucked pelvis is not good news.

When the pelvis is tucked, the butt can't work. The insertions of the muscles are in a position where they can't pull anything anywhere. This seriously compromises the stability of the pelvis, the efficiency of the gait and yes, the tug-of-war between the butt and the pelvic floor. The pelvic floor loses its partner.

To top it off, tucking the pelvis makes the pelvic floor into an actual horizontal floor, so now it has to carry more of the weight of the organs above. To keep everything in, it has to clench. And hold. And hold. But if the butt isn't pulling from the other side, the pelvic floor just ends up dragging the tailbone inward. And so its own frame is getting smaller and it has to get smaller with it. Clench and hold.

The poor pelvic floor is clenching, shortening and holding with all its might, but muscle contractions become less and less effective as the muscle is shortened. (It has to do with the overlapp of the fibers in them, but that is a topic for another day.) The overworked pelvic floor becomes stiff and we finally start noticing the trouble -- pain, incontinence, prolapse.

And that's why a tucked pelvis is a disaster for the pelvic floor.

**** Why not kegels
The pelvic floor is supposed to be strong and supple. It needs to react to breathing, pull of other muscles around and changes in the pressure in the abdominopelvic cavity.

Due to our modern lives, most of us are using our pelvic floor wrong. We turn it into a "floor" by tucking the pelvis and we don't let it play with its friends -- the butt and the diaphragm. We end up with a pelvic floor that is shortened, stiff and overworked. As a result, it can't contract as it should, so we /think/ it's /weak/.

Unfortunately, what kind of advice will the owner of this poor pelvic floor get? In 99/100 cases, that would be kegels. And what do kegels do? Assuming a weak pelvic floor, a kegel is supposed to make it stronger by regular contractions.

And so the chronicly contracted, shortened, stiff and overworked pelvic floor gets a regular regime of /more/ contracting and shortening. Because a kegel is just like tightening the string on a drawstring bag -- it completely misses the actual problem most people have.

It usually works for a while. Training will increase the strength of the pelvic floor, so it becomes better able to work in these horrible conditions. The symptoms will improve temporarily, but are likely to come back, because the real problem is only getting worse.

Plus, let's be honest, kegels are a funny one. Why should we even need such a strange exercise? For most issues, functional exercises tend to provide the most benefit. The kind of movement that make sense in context: in daily life or sports. Just because we strenghten a muscle using an isolated exercise, doesn't mean it will activate when it should in real life. Movement is as much about the brain as it is about muscles.

**** When kegels are the right solution
Some people might benefit from kegels, if their pelvic floor is actually weak. Although, even in this case, the kegels should be paired with other exercises and lifestyle changes.

Kegels can also help us to "get to know" our pelvic floor muscles and learn to activate them. For this purpose, the quality of the exercise matters much more than the quantity. And most people are doing kegels wrong: using either the wrong muscles, or focusing only on the contraction, while the release is at least equally important.

If you believe kegels might be the right thing for you, I encourage you to find a good pelvic floor physiotherapist who can make sure that it really is what you need and that you do them right.

**** If not kegels, then what?
Pelvic floor dysfunction is one of our floppy fins. Just like orcas in captivity often end up with a bent-over dorsal fin, humans in the modern world often end up with pelvic floor issues. The reason is the same, lack of the mechanical inputs that our bodies evolved with, rely on and take for granted. (You can read more about floppy fins here !!!!!!!!!!!!!)

How can we get a healthy, supple and strong pelvic floor without kegels?

You already have a part of the answer. It's good breathing, sitting and standing (especially the position of the pelvis, which I wrote about more here as well !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!)

Good posture puts the pelvic floor in a position where it can work. The next step is to give it enought opportunities to do just that.

Walking and squatting are among the best movements that optimally engage the pelvic floor. They both involve the whole body and have been ubiquitous in the lives of our ancestors for millions of years. When we lack either or both, we begin hurting in many different places, but the pelvic floor is one of the first victims.

I wrote more about the basic movements that we are missing here !!!!!!!!!!!

So how is your relationship with kegels? You can let me know if you feel like it.

*** Can I drop my body off at the gym and pick it up when it's done?


As a teenager I used to always listen to music or audiobooks when I went for a run. I did it because running and exercise were a chore - a boring, annoying, but necessary chore. I didn't do it for the fun of it. I just wanted to lose weight and get into shape (mostly so that I would be able to run away from the aliens if I found myself in an episode of Doctor Who). I loved the feeling I got after running, but definitely not during. 

It's common to see exercise as a chore that we just want to get over with, but today I will tell you about all the reasons why a focused movement practice is good for not only your body, but also your brain. 

*** I move, therefore I am

When we talk about movement, we often think of musculoskeletal system - the muscles and the bones. We tend to forget that there is one more very important system involved: the nervous system. 

If I want to drink my tea, I just reach my hand, pick up the cup, bring it to my mouth and drink. No real thinking required. But even such a seemingly simple movement requires an incredibly well coordinated effort from a large number of muscles. Everything needs to be just right. Just the right strength of a contraction at just the right time. And that's what the brain is there for.

#+begin_quote
Movement might actually be the reason why we have a brain at all! 
#+end_quote


According to one theory, animals evolved a brain in order to be able to freely move through their environment. The complex interactions with one's surroundings simply required a brain. Plants manage without one, but they usually don't get very far. Even for us humans, a species that likes to use our brains for a bunch of stuff, movement still takes up a massive part of its capacity. 

*** Your brain prefers dancing over sudoku

I have nothing against sudoku, but if you would like to train your brain then movement can get you better results. There are [[https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa022252][studies that look specifically at the effect of dancing on the cognitive abilities and dementia risk in elderly people]]. The effects are overwhelmingly positive and the best out of the tested activities, followed by crossword puzzles and reading. Biking, swimming and golf however didn't make much of a difference. 

#+begin_quote
What is it about dancing that was so beneficial for the brain? The most likely answer is that it was the need to learn new things and to constantly react and adjust to the music and the dancing partner. 
#+end_quote

In dancing there is a tight feedback loop involved in dancing. The brain needs to carefully monitor the inputs - music, partner, space, own body, and decide how to react to it. There are many possibilities and often new moves. The environment is complex and our movement through it is complex. It is what the brain is so good at and also what is good for it. 

I would guess that dancing isn't the only type of movment that could provide this benefit, although I can't back it up by any studies, as most focus on ballroom dancing. But we can experience similar movement complexity and interactions with our environment in other situations too. A hike through a challengening terrain, balancing, climbing a tree. Maybe even an artificial obstacle course. 

*** We are what we focus on the most

As  the saying goes: practice makes perfect.  But only under one important condition. The practice has to be focused.  
Our brain is able to perform familiar movements on autopilot.  It simply starts the stored program and executes the pattern.  It’s  fast and efficient.  But what if the pattern blueprint isn’t correct?  Well in that case we will be practicing and training the incorrect movement over and over again. 

To improve,  we need to establish a feedback loop. The brain needs to be  continuously adjusting the movement  in reaction  to the feedback it receives.  That requires focus. 

We can hack this focus with certain types of movements,  the kind that just won’t work if we’re not responsive enough.  And  that brings us back to the ballroom dancing.  But also balancing.  If you do it wrong,  you fall.  Hiking  in  terrain that isn’t flat and level  requires a  similar amount of focus and  continuous response to the environment.  Jumping rope  also provides an immediate feedback forcing you to do it well or not at all.

With many other movements it’s up to us to bring in the focus and awareness.

The good news is,  that the focus is our key to improving the quality of our movements.  If  a  movement pattern stored in our brain isn’t good enough,  all we need is focused practice to imprint a  new pattern.  And  although it does take time,  the more we practice, the faster it happens.

*** Play, practice, train

One of the foundations of good and safe movement is self-awareness.  We all have our limitations, but being aware of them is what allows us to use our full abilities and  reduce the risk of injuries. 


#+begin_quote
How to build good movement? Play, practice, train. In that order. With self-awareness.
#+end_quote

The ultimate way to develop self-awareness is play. Play is an exploration. An exploration of one's own abilities, of the environment and how they can play together. In play, we test our boundaries, we feel what feels right and we experiment with various ways of doing the same. It allows us to know ourselves and to find what works. 

Only then can we move onto practice. Practice is deliberate and focused. Now that we have explored the possibilities through play, we know better where we want to get. We can then start practicing the movements. Focusing on the feedback from our bodies and our environment and using it to refine the movement. 

Training is the last step that only makes sense after we have been through play and practice stages. Now that we have a correct movement pattern blueprint in the brain, we can start adding intensity to it, whether through higher loads, speeds or number of repetitions. 

For most people who aren't athletes, the play and practice stages are the most important. They train the brain the most, they help us develop self-awareness, correct movement patterns and despite what it might soud like, they do also train and strenghten the muscles. Plus, it's where most of the fun is.

#+begin_quote
Nobody would dream of leaving their brain behind when going to practice playing a  music instrument.  Practicing movement isn’t really that different.

*** Disconnected and dysfunctional

I used to be a nerdy little bookworm as a kid and as a teenager. And honestly a bit of a couch potato. If I could sit in a comfy armchair with a book, I would sit in a comfy armchair with a book.

I also used to be a "good girl". Doing what I was expected to do and following the rules both spoken and implied. So I would sit "properly", never run around in the corridors and favour academic achievements over physical prowess.

It was subconcious - I never really decided not to move - but it was happening and it had consequences.

I was just 12 when a doctor told me that my knee pain was due to worn cartilages and there was nothing to do about it. By the time I entered my twenties I not only had bad knees, but also a wonky ankle, flat feet and regular lower back pain.

And I don't think I even understood how much it affected me mentally...

I wasn't happy with the way I looked and I ingored as best as I could the way I felt in my own body.

[[file:move_more_better_Nori_2013_576x1024.png]]

*** It changed, thankfully

It happened in 2015. The beginning of the change, I mean. It was a cold Norwegian January and I was an ever-so-nerdy bookish PhD student. That day I went to a proper gym - probably for the first time in my life. I was suffering from a new-years-resolutionitis and had a vague feeling I should "start exercising (somehow)". I was looking for something that would require as little energy and time as possible.

Well that trip to the gym never repeated itself. But boy oh boy, was it an eye-opener. I was weak, clumsy, awkward and stiff. I had no idea how to move.

Thankfully, I had enough self-awareness left to realize I had no control and was on my way to an injury.

Coming home that day, I started searching the internet. Trying to answer questions like why can't I squat? And this was the real beginning. The nerd's way.

I was studying biophysics and suddenly realized that the mechanics of the human body was actually right up my alley!

I loved reading about it. And I still do!

And before I knew it, I was applying what I was reading to myself and eventually advising others. Also reading more, taking courses, and learning more.

Movement became my passion.

*** Reconnecting with myself

I don't go to the gym. I don't really play sports. I have a full time job and two kids and I don't enjoy gyms and sports enough to make time for them.

Instead I just move.

I make space for movement in my daily life and in my mind, because I know now that it is essential.

My movement practice keeps me
pain free, confident,
moving with ease,
able to enjoy physical activity and
connected to my body and the world around me.

I finally feel at home in my body. I finally feel like I belong. And it's a good feeling.

:END:

I don’t eat a “varied and balanced diet” anymore. I don’t do five a day. There is no rainbow on my plate. And no holy (whole)  grains.  Zero fibre,  actually. On the other hand, I eat lots of saturated fat, cholesterol and salt. 

I eat meat, eggs, fish, salt and water. And that's pretty much it 99% of the time. 

And believe it or not I have never felt better.  

How did I get here? Let us start from the middle...

*** No matter how hard I tried, everything was wrong

My first daugther was a bit over a year old and I was having probably the most difficult time of my life. 

Most people would consider our diet at that time very healthy. It was full of fruits and vegetables, whole grains, heart-healthy plant fats and only relatively small amounts of meat. Everything was prepared at home from fresh ingredients. 

**** Child with alergies

We didn't really have much choice. From the moment the kiddo was born, it was quite clear that she inherited her mother's disposition for allergies. We quickly identified milk and eggs as the main culprit and I dropped them from my diet like a hot potato, because I didn't want to stop breastfeeding her. 

But that wasn't enough. She kept reacting to random things I ate. And when she started solids also to the things she ate. It was a nightmare trying to identify the culprits and medical testing provided only some answers, and clearly not all. So I kept eliminating more and more foods from my diet. 

She was actually doing very well for a child with allergies - most likely thanks to the breastmilk - but I on the other hand... not so much. 

**** I started falling apart
#+attr_html: :alt A picture of a woman with long hair, in a tank top, sitting by a dining table, smiling at the camera with a bowl of oatmeal in front of her. Her arms are somewhat thin and there are slight bags under her eyes. 
#+caption: That is oatmeal in my bowl. January 2018, 8 months post partum. Tired.
[[file:carnivore_Nori2018_411x637.jpg]]


It slowly crept up on me, but by the time she was a year, I was hardly recognising myself. I was skinny, weak, perpetually tired and always sick.  Any virus passing by would get me and keep me miserable for many weeks. I even managed to break two of my ribs in a coughing fit.  Really.  

My hands were covered in eczema I couldn’t get rid of for ages. My digestion was miserable. I was having so much bloating and unexpected trips to the bathroom that it was often difficult to leave the house.  But the worst of it was the mental part. I was anxious and angry and scared. Sometimes I didn't even know why. I was just not coping at all.

According to my doctor, everything looked fine. 

*** Just meat? Are you out of your gourd?

It continued for way too long without much improvement. Until one day in May 2019, when I was 30 years old and the little one has just turned two. 

And here I have to give credit to my husband who showed me a [[https://imgur.com/gallery/mkzQ6Kk][picture of married couple]] he found online and asked me how old I though they were. I guessed maybe late thirties, at most early fourties. I was super wrong. She was 46 and he was 61. 

And they attributed their youthfull looks and good health to only having eaten beef for the last 20 years. 

**** Carnivore

The people in the picture were [[https://www.allthingscarnivore.com/joe-and-charlene-andersons-carnivore-diet-experience/][Joe and Charlene Andersen]] and as we quickly found out, they are far from the only ones following some version of the so-called carnivore diet, and reporting incredible health benefits. 

#+begin_quote
Carnivore... as in no plant foods at all. I was flabbergasted. It can't be!
#+end_quote


I mean, everyone knows, that vegetables are nutrition, right? You can't live without vegetables!

#+begin_quote
Or?
#+end_quote


Turns out you can. And more than that. You can thrive. We discovered a big community of carnivores online, quite a few of them doctors, researchers and dieticians. And so many stories from all sorts of people. They often sounded like miracles. People who went into remission from their "uncurable" chronic diseases, from eczemas, depression, anxiety, through Crohn's, type 2 diabetes, psoriasis, juvenile arthritis, to epilepsy, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and tooth cavities...

Some even had their grey hair grow dark again. 

#+begin_quote
I usually follow the rule that if something sound too good to be true, then it probably isn't true. 
#+end_quote

*** But there wasn't much to lose this time. 

Of course I didn't go in blindly. I read and I read and I double-checked and carefully considered arguments from all the sides. I was a PhD student at the time and let me tell you, a PhD is mostly a degree in reading scientific literature. So that is what I did here too. And things did check out and did make sense. The last thing left was to try. 

My personal little miracle 

We were going to try it for a month. It has now been over 3 years. It really felt like experiencing my own little miracle. 

#+attr_html: :alt A picture of a woman in a black dress holding a child on her hip, standing by a Christmas tree.

#+begin_quote
I do indeed thrive.
#+end_quote


- *Digestion* - better than ever. And it used to be really bad. Now I don't think about 99% of the time. Have you ever experienced zero bloat? It's glorious.

- *Skin* - better than ever. Eczema was gone within a week and acne a few weaks later. Plus I don't burn in the sun anymore. Go figure. 

- *Pollen allergies* - basically gone. As long as I am perfectly plant free (including spices) I don't experience any symptoms. And I used to have terrible allergies fo 9 months out of a year!

- *Mental health* - much better. I didn't realize I used to have anxiety until it was gone. The impending sense of doom now only returns when I eat some sugar. 

- *Resistance to getting sick* - definitely better. I still get sick, seeing that I live with two small people that will gladly sneeze in your eyeball and that visit a breeding gourn for pathogens daily (a.k.a. kindergarten). But the illnesses are milder and pass much faster. 


Over the last three years I have been experimenting with adding other foods to my diet and every time I end up going back to a pure carnivore of meat, fish, eggs, salt and water. Because many of the benefits I mentioned here disappear for me, once I add some plant foods. Some people don't feel a difference from adding some coffee or avocado or spices or other plants, but I really do. 

And for as long as this will make me feel the best, I will continue. 

#+begin_quote
The carnivore diet and how and why it works has remained a source of fascination for me. I have never before experienced such a profound change. I wouldn't hesitate to say that carnivore saved my life. And it all makes sense. 

And that's why I just can't keep it to myself.

:END:

I really really tried to start an online business, but it was just an endless struggle. I just couldn't get myself to do the things and I couldn't get it right. And so I finally stopped. It was a relief and a disappointment at the same time. And it actually took me close to a year to figure out what went "wrong", and why it's for the best. 

If you are looking for a guide on how to start making money online, this is not it. This is me tracing back my steps, trying to figure out where and why I "failed". And the short story is: It didn't agree with me. The long story is… well, longer:

*** A course that was supposed to save me

It was at a time in my life when I was seriously struggling with balancing work and family. I had a small child that needed my presence more than the average toddler, but I just had to go back to work, there was no other choice. So I was drowning in guilt, fatigue and tears (both mine and hers).

#+begin_quote
I wanted a way out.
#+end_quote


And that way out seemed to appear on Instagram, out of all places. Some of the people I was following mentioned having gone through a life-changing course about starting an online business. So I followed the account of the lovely lady who runs it. And at first I didn't think it was the right thing for me, but with each passing post and each passing month, I was getting more and more convinced to give it a try.

I followed for about a year before I signed up. I already had a blog from before (which was just for fun), and I felt I had things to say. So why not?

#+begin_quote
I gave it my all.
#+end_quote

I was posting on my blog, on Facebook, on Instagram, sending a newsletter, I had several "free" ebooks that I exchanged for people's email addresses and at the end of the course, I had my paid ebook. I was proud of it. It was good.

#+begin_quote
And then I hit a wall.*
#+end_quote

I couldn't get myself to promote my ebook. I couldn't get myself to mention it on social media. I kept lowering the price of my ebook every few weeks. I lost steam completely. I tried to pick up where I left again and again, thinking it was writer's block or imposter syndrome or whatever, but I just couldn't get myself to write and post with any regularity again. There were months between each addition and writing was a pain.

Eventually, I stopped. I felt like a failure. I had all the tools necessary to get this to work, and I have seen other people who made it. But not me. I simply wasn't good enough.

At least that is how I felt for a very long time.

*** Making people want

I learned a lot from the course.

Did you know that most people buy only after five or more contacts with the seller? And that marketers are deliberately appealing to our feelings and telling us how their product will make us feel and how it will change our lives? That they know we are more likely to buy under time pressure, so they come up with time-limited offers, real or fake?

It's nothing new, really. Nothing ground-breaking. It's like those fabric softener ads on TV that show people running through fields of flowers, rather than telling you that it will make your towels soft and smell like some chemical approximation of flowers. A bit ridiculous, right?

I kind of knew or suspected many of it before, but reading it black on white was a little jarring. Still, I tried to do it too, but I was really bad at it. I just couldn't do it properly. It was a topic in the course too, actually: "I am bad at selling". We were told we deserved to be paid for our efforts and for all the value we were providing for people. After all, the money would allow us to make more content. It was a reciprocal relationship. And all of that makes perfect sense, of course. But I was still failing miserably.

**** It's magic

It's only recently that I started looking at it from the other side though. From the side of a customer. We all know marketing and ads are fake and manipulative, yet we all think we are immune to them. I admit I did. I thought I wouldn't let something like that influence my choices. 

Then I read about Tristan Harris - a technology ethicist, vocal critic of social media and founder of the [[https://www.humanetech.com/][Center for Humane Technology]]. He compared social media to magicians. We all know magicians are using tricks and we are often trying to look for it, yet almost all of us get fooled over and over again. It has nothing to do with intelligence. They are simply using our inherent human "weaknesses", the way our brain works, to trick us. But while magicians do it for our delight, social media and ads do it for other reasons. Why would companies use as much money as they do for advertising, if it didn't work?

#+begin_quote
Manipulation doesn't stop working just because we know we are being manipulated.
#+end_quote

**** Social media work for marketers

Tristan Harris is featured in the Netflix documentary The Social Dilemma and also in Johann Hari's book Stolen Focus. I enjoyed Stolen Focus tremendously, and while it covers a lot more ground than just social media, they are one of the main topics. At the time when I was reading the book I was feeling overwhelmed and like I had too many tabs open in my brain. Stolen Focus inspired me to quit social media and it actually helped.

Ever wondered how social media make money? We, the end users, are certainly not paying them. Their business model relies on money from ads. The marketers are their real customers, while our eyeballs are the product. In order to make advertisers happy, social media need to keep us scrolling for as long as possible (to see the most ads), and preferably to buy as well. They don't care whether we feel good being there, or angry and upset, as long as we are there. 

In my online business course, I learned a lot about how Facebook was this wonderful money machine. How easy it was to target the right people, how it would learn who to show the ads to and how for every cent you throw in for ads, you get two back. (Given you manage to write a good ad, which I never could, but that's not the point.)

Social media are full of people trying to sell. We are interacting with ads without even knowing they are ads. They might not be selling anything in that post, just getting us ready to buy in a day or a week. It's sneaky. And it works.

*** Selling dreams

#+begin_quote
I started wondering how much I was influenced by these subtle and less subtle ads.
#+end_quote

What about the course I was so sad about not being able to buy, since it cost 2000 euros? If my brain wasn't massaged for more than a year, would I have even wanted it? What course is even worth 2000 euros? Would my life have been easier if I have never heard about it? Would it be so life-changinly (I know it's not a word) worth it, if I had bought it? I don't have answers. Just questions.

Would I have bought that online business course, expensive as it was, if I weren't looking at all the posts about traveling, exotic places, spending time with family, all while making money? The word freedom popping up over and over again? Did I want to learn and do online marketing? Or did I want the freedom? Because freedom can't really be sold. The real product was a course about online marketing. What made me want to buy it was the vision of freedom. I wanted the result, not the journey.

Now, I don't want to throw any shade on that particular course and its author. It's a good course that worked for a good number of people and she never recommends anything outright unethical. I think she has more integrity than most marketers. She is also honest about the course not being a magic bullet and about success requiring a lot of hard work, time and dedication. She never lies about things.

And yet. And yet I wonder how many of us get seduced by the regular images of far-away places and vague promise of freedom. 

#+begin_quote
Seduced by posts written by a skilled marketer, delivered to us several times a day by powerful algorithms behind social media.
#+end_quote


I'm not saying it's unethical. I'm just realizing how susceptible I am to the marketing magic. And I'm realizing it's not something I would be ok with doing, personally. I don't want to make people want things, I don't want to create desires that might not have been there, just to sell my stuff. Whether I deserve the reward or not. I think there is already too much wanting in this world.

*** Gift economy

I realize I am talking from a place of privilege. I have a stable, full-time job that I love and that provides enough money for a fairly comfortable life. Nothing extra, no exotic places, but safety and security. I have good affordable childcare and two little kids that enjoy spending their time there. I don't really need a side hustle. I have the choice. I am well aware that not everyone does.

Sometimes I wish though that the world would be a bit different. A bit kinder and gentler, less eager to make quick and easy money. I read an absolutely wonderful book - Braiding Sweetgrass by Robin Wall Kimmerer. It's very difficult to say what that book is about. Robin is a botanist and a Native American and in Braiding Sweetgrass she talks a lot about plants, about nature and about our relationship with them from the point of view of indigenous peoples. It's an incredibly beautiful book full of wisdom and love.

I never thought I would be reminded of Braiding Sweetgrass while thinking of online marketing, but here we are. One of the ideas Robin introduces is gift economy. 

#+begin_quote
Gift economy. A world where every living thing freely shares their gifts with the others, and in return receives gifts with gratitude and respect for the giver. A world of reciprocity. A world where one doesn't just ask: "what can I get?", but mostly: "what can I give?". A world where gifts are appreciated and treasured.
#+end_quote

The plentiful bounty of Americas at the time when European colonizers arrived wasn't an accident. It was the result of careful stewardship of the land by the native peoples. It was gift economy between humans and nature in practice. It was the result of honorable harvest - never taking more than is given, never taking more than a half, giving back in return,…

Can you imagine a harvest where you only harvest half?! Crazy. And beautiful.

Now I know the world is headed in the opposite way nowadays, but that doesn't mean I have to follow. And so I am quite content with my short-lived venture into the competitive world of online business being over. It wasn't for me.

I have recently finished reading Malcolm Kendrick's books /The Great Cholesterol Con/ and /The Clot Thickens/ and it was a treat. It was insightful, captivating and so very funny, just dripping with dry, British humour. And with frustration. A LOT of frustration.

*** What causes heart disease?
**** The cholesterol hypothesis
He is on a mission to tell people that the cholesterol hypothesis of cardiovascular disease is wrong.

#+begin_quote
The cholesterol hypothesis:
1. The amount of saturated fat we eat increases the level of LDL (Low Density Lipoprotein) particles in the blood.
2. High level of LDL in the blood leads to the creation of atherosclerotic plaques (which is basically what we call cardiovascular disease).
   - A hypothesis not as unanimously accepted as one might think.
#+end_quote

(By the way, if you know a slightly different version of this, such as switching out LDL for apoB, or saturated fat for cholesterol or for lack of unsaturated fat, well, yes, they keep changing the hypothesis to stay ahead of all the facts that contradict it. But it's still the same thing.)

The poor guy has already written several scientific papers and two books for the general public trying to debunk the cholesterol hypothesis (/The Great Cholesterol Con/ is one of them) and not much has changed. So he also wrote a book trying not as much to debunk the cholesterol hypothesis, but rather offer a better one. One that makes more sense. And that's what /The Clot Thickens/ is about.

**** The blood clot hypothesis
What, if not cholesterol/saturated fat/LDL causes atherosclerosis? As Malcolm Kendrick points out, that is not actually a good question to ask. A better question is "How?". Or to put it another way: "What is the process leading to atherosclerosis?". And the hypothesis he puts forward is that the atherosclerotic plaques are remnants of old blood clots. And there are many, many things that can cause these blood clots and so there are many, many "causes" to atherosclerosis.

It does fit the facts pretty nicely. From what the plaques contain and how they are organised, to how they grow, what happens when they rupture and down to the biggest well-known and less well-known risk factors for heart disease. It all fits.

I am not going to go into the details of it right now, any interested reader can find the books and read all the science and detailed explanations for themselves (and did I mentioned the books are super funny?). I think one day I will write about this more though, to sort out my thoughts, but don't hold your breath, I don't have a good track record of publishing often.

Anyway, there was something else I wanted to write about today,

*** How can there be such a huge disagreement?
Malcolm Kendrick is clearly a very smart, very well educated doctor who has studied the topic for many years and he is in opposition to what the consensus on cardiovascular disease is. And while he is far from alone in this, the cholesterol sceptics are in the minority.

And this is not a disagreement on some small details, no, this is as fundamental a disagreement as can be. And it would be unwise to disregard one side of the argument only because they are in the minority (or the majority, for that matter). 

#+begin_quote
For the majority to be wrong is a very normal situation in the history of not only science and medicine, but all of humankind. 
#+end_quote

The arguments put forward by Dr. Kendrick make a lot of sense and show a lot of holes in the cholesterol hypothesis. (Big holes, btw. Big. Holes.) Holes that get very nicely filled by the blood clot hypothesis.

But, I like to hear out all sides of an argument and so I went ahead and started reading. I looked at both peer-reviewed scientific papers and at what experts, such as Dr. Thomas Dayspring, have to say on the matter on social media.  Because, I thought, surely, these other smart, educated doctors and researchers who defend the cholesterol hypothesis must have some good arguments for it.

And they do. Sort of.

It's just that these arguments have a very different focus.

*** How? or Why?
Digging into the cholesterol hypothesis, it felt like it lost the sight of the forest for the trees. I learned about receptors that help transport cholesterol from the gut and into the cells of the gut wall, and about other ones that can toss it back out; I learned about receptors that start the transport of LDL particles through the endothelial cells (the cells that line the insides of the blood vessels) into the wall of he blood vessel; I read about how laminar and turbulent flow affect the proteoglycan content in the blood vessel walls; I read about the different reactions that can happen to LDL once it's in the wall...

There was a lot of detail (and little that would tie it to actual outcomes in people). But even in the papers and talks that were supposed to provide an overview, it all felt disjointed. "We know about this bit, and that bit, and a few more. And there is /stuff/ happening between them." I couldn't help but think: "Yes, you showed this, but what does it /mean/? Does it even relate to this next bit? Where is the bigger picture?"

#+begin_quote
It seems like the "proper" science is not supposed to ask why. Only concern itself with the how. 
#+end_quote

Don't get me wrong. The /how/ is bloody important. And I have written a few papers in my life and know how science and modern publishing work, I have no illusions there. It's tricky enough to defend the tiny /hows/ one manages to disentangle from the complexity of life, venturing into guessing about the /why/ is thin ice, and almost feels a bit... unscientific?

But the /why/ matters a lot. Let me explain on an example:

**** Why do LDL particles cross the endothelium?
Initially, when the cholesterol hypothesis came to be, it was thought that LDL particles just passively diffused through the endothelial cells and got stuck inside the arterial wall underneath them. If you know anything about cells, you might know that they are not very fond of just letting things diffuse through them (thank gods), and they are very picky about what they let through and what they don't. And that is actually the case here as well.

We do have enough evidence now to know that LDLs don't /just/ float through the cells. No, the cells manufacture a receptor, catch themselves an LDL particle, pull it in, move it through and spit it out on the other side. Well, we are quite sure of the catching and pulling-in part, slightly less sure of the spitting out part, but it seems like it does happen. Anyway, even the mainstream view has now admitted that this process is an active one and not passive, as it was assumed before.

#+begin_quote
The endothelial cell actively pulls in an LDL particle and moves it through itself to the other side.
#+end_quote

Why is this a big deal? Well, if the process had been passive, one could imagine that having too much LDL in the blood would make too much of it go through the wall. But if the cells decide themselves and if they have to use energy and actually work to get it through, it's not an accident.

#+begin_quote
Why are they doing it? Why are they moving it at all? Why so much? Is it just to give us heart disease?
#+end_quote

And this, /this/, is where I think the main difference between the proponents and opponents of the cholesterol hypothesis lies.

Because, I believe, most people who are in favour of the cholesterol hypothesis would tell you it doesn't matter why. 

*** It's a life philosophy
I think it comes down to how one sees the human body and actually the nature itself. Whether you believe it's "made" well or whether you feel like it's lucky that it works at all.

And this is not really a question of religion. We could have been well-made by millions of years of evolution just as well as by a higher power.

#+begin_quote
But that's what it boils down to. Do we trust that the body we have is mostly trying to do the right thing? Or do we think it's held together by pure luck - a mix of random happy accidents and countless mistakes, a ticking bomb waiting to explode on us?
#+end_quote

Because if you believe the body makes sense, then the question /why/ it's doing something is highly relevant, especially if it's happening in virtually everyone.

*** The cholesterol gamble
The issue with LDL is that practically all of us will have to choose at some point. The mainstream cardiovascular disease prevention and treatment has been steadily reducing what is considered to be a normal blood level of LDL particles. There are those who think we should all be chewing on statins. Unless this changes, we will all one day be told by our doctor that our "cholesterol" is too high and we should get on the statins.

I have been reading and listening to many people smarter than me from both sides and, while I keep my mind open, I know what makes the most sense to me. It will be a well-informed decision when I one day refuse a statin, if ever offered to me. It's still a gamble, of course, but taking the statin would be too.

To be honest, Malcolm Kendrick quite convinced me that the cholesterol hypothesis doesn't hold water. But what definitely doesn't make sense to me is this idea that we need to micromanage our bodies with medications and unnatural lifestyle changes to keep them from going off the rails and getting us killed.

And if I'm wrong, so be it. I will rather live in a world where my body is on my side, than one where I have to fear it.

*** Hello, my name is Nori, and I am an addict.

For the longest time, I didn't want to admit it to myself. I thought I was in control. I thought I was "moderating", whatever that might mean. But in truth I was moderating myself to a serving of my drug of choice dozens of times every day. Simply because I wouldn't feel good without it. Simply because I /wanted/ it. A lot. 

There were times when I would have so much I would make myself feel completely sick. Heart beating uncomfortably fast, body breaking out in cold sweat, headaches, nausea, dry mouth and unquenchable thirst. When I would wake up the next morning, after what was always a bad night of sleep, most of the unpleasantness would still be there (and more).

One time I spent the whole night throwing up, until I finally fell asleep on the bathroom floor. When I woke up some two hours later, utterly miserable, my first thoughts went to whether I had any more left. 

You might think that all that yuckiness would have detered me from having more. I would have thought so at least. But it didn't. Not one bit. I wanted more. I /needed/ more.

*** White powder
Are you wondering what my drug of choice is? You are not going to like the answer. Just how I didn't like it.

It is a substance extracted from certain plants, that, when ingested, stimulates the same regions in the brain as cocaine and amphetamines, giving you a dopamine high. Unfortunately, eating bigger amounts of this substance makes the brain more and more used to it. And getting too much of it damages the blood vessels over time, increasing massively the risk of cardiovascular, kidney and Alzheimer's diseases. It also leads to insulin resistance, causing type 2 diabetes, increasing risk of cancer, fertility problems, gastrointestinal issues, fatty liver disease... just to mention a few. It affects the /whole/ body.

It sounds nasty, doesn't it?
Yet we eat it daily. Heck, we feed it to our kids even more than ourselves.

Did you guess?

It's sugar.

And yes, it really does work similarly to a drug in the brain. [[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1931610/][Researchers found that rats would even prefer sugar, and surprisingly also artificial sweetener, over cocaine]]. [[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2235907/][Others have found the same - rats addicted to sugar with typical addict behavious of bingeing, withdrawal and craving, and the related changes in the chemistry of brain.]] [[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002822310006449][Dr. Robert Lustig who has spent a big chunk of his career researching fructose compares it to alcohol]] because of how the metabolism of the two is similar and how they both affect our behaviour. (Did you know, that both alcohol and fructose consumption lead to fatty liver and in worst case liver cirrhosis?) Several others ([[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2235907/][Nicole Avena et. al]], [[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28835408/][James DiNicolantonio et. al]], [[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23719144/][Serge Ahmed et. al]]) have written about the addictive potential of sugar. 

We know that [[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1499267115300721][sugar is one of the main factors behind our insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes epidemic]]. There is also evidence that [[https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/01.CIR.98.5.398][insulin resistance is a bit of a prerequisite for cardiovascular disease]]. [[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7246646/][Alzheimer's disease has been called type 3 diabetes]] and it seems it [[https://insulinresistance.org/index.php/jir/article/view/15][could be caused by an insulin resistant brain not being able to get the nutrition it needs]]. Insulin resistance (from too much sugar consumption) also increases the risk and deadliness of several cancers, like [[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32530506/][breast cancer]], [[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12509402/][prostate cancer]] and [[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11535544/][colorectal cancer]].

So yes, sugar is a drug, and a dangerous one at that.

*** Natural this - natural that, moderation, and other fairy tales
Now I can almost hear you protesting.

/But sugar is natural!/ Yes, just like cocaine, alcohol and cyanide.

/But our bodies need it!/ Well, they actually don't. You can very well live a life eating zero(!) carbs. There are both essential amino acids and essential fats that we /need/ to have in our diet to survive, but there are no essential carbs. If you think about how the Inuits used to live, or how our ancestors probably lived during the Ice Ages, it's clear humans don't /need/ carbohydrates.  

/But it's healthy in moderation!/ What exactly is moderation? How much? How many grams per day is moderation? Is a tablespoon of Nutella 10 times a day too much? What about 8 bananas? What about 10 tablespoons of Nutella, 8 bananas, 5 cookies, a bowl of cereal with orange juice for breakfast, a good portion of pasta for dinner, a sandwich for lunch, a sweetened "yogurt" and a nut bar in between? Is it moderation? I honestly don't know.

*** Sugar is sugar is sugar (but isn't sugar)
Maybe you're annoyed at me right now for mixing sugar with other carbs. And I am mixing them. Shamelessly. Because when it comes to it, the moment they actually enter your body, the two are indistinguishable.

And I don't mean enter the mouth. Strictly speaking, our digestive tract is still the outside, just think about it like a very long hole in a human-shaped donut. So when any carbohydrate is entering the body, it is when it's been already digested, broken up by enzymes and is entering the gut wall. And that is something only monosaccharides do. Monosaccharides -- mostly glucose, fructose and galactose. All of which we call sugar. Table sugar is a disaccharide also called sucrose -- which is a glucose-fructose pair, and milk sugar -- lactose -- is a glucose-galactose pair. And starches are polysaccharides made of many glucose units. 

Is your head spinning a bit from all the sugars too?

So if we can call glucose "sugar", and we can call fructose "(fruit) sugar", and call table sugar "sugar", then I think I can very well call starches "sugar" too, if I please. By the time they enter the body they are a "sugar" anyway (whatever that might be, but glucose in this case).

So again, how do we moderate this?

*** The destiny of the sugar we eat
Do you know what happens to the sugar we eat? 
Carbohydrates get broken down into their smallest unit as they travel from the mouth to the intestines. This mostly ends up being glucose, so that is what I will talk about further.

After the gut cells take them in, they send them straight to the liver. Why? Because too much glucose in the blood is very dangerous and would literally kill us. So the liver is the gatekeeper making sure there isn't too much entering the blood stream at once. 

But the liver can't just hold it all in in the form of glucose, that doesn't work. It releases a part into the blood (that's why our blood sugar rises after eating) and it turns as much of the rest as possible into glycogen -- our animal form of "starch" made of a string of glucose molecules. But the liver can only store about a 100g of it. When that storage is full, it has no other choice than to turn it into fat and send it off to fat cells for long term storage. Or release more into the blood 

Now muscles can store some glycogen too, about 200g in the whole body, but that glycogen is unable to leave the muscle cells, so it only gets used up when all of these muscles are working. 

So the total sugar storage of the body is about 300g. Could that be the moderation limit? Weeeell, I don't know about you, but I doubt I empty my storage daily. The muscles hold 200g which is about 1000 kcal which would have to be burned daily by working those muscles. That amounts to about 80 minutes of running or two hours of cycling. 

And there is 100g -- 500 kcal in the liver. But those only get used when our insulin levels are low, so for most people eating 3-5 meals a day with carbs here and there, that would be at best during the night. But yes, a night without eating will probably deplete the liver of glycogen.

From this, 100g of carbs a day looks like a much more reasonable "moderation". But the truth is most modern people would consider that low-carb.

*** Can addicts moderate?
Moderation, this tempting elusive idea, even if we could define what it exactly means with regards to sugar, does it work when addicted?

Looking at how we treat all other addictions, I would say not. Nobody in their right mind would tell their recovering alcoholic friend to "just have one beer". We know what would happen.

And judging from my own experience, no, sugar addicts can't moderate either.

*** I used to be a grazer 
People have a lot of ideas about what an addiction looks like. I know I did. And what I was doing did not strike me as one at all.

By all accounts, I had a great relationship with food in my youth. I didn't have any negative thoughts about food. I was enjoying it without any guilt, I didn't deny myself foods I wanted, I didn't binge, nor restrict. At all. Despite being chubby, I never considered going on a diet. I felt like I ate well -- mostly homemade food, varied diet and yes, candy when I felt like it. The truth is though, I felt like candy waaay too often. I never binged, but I /grazed/. And the sum of it was... a lot. Enough that now in retrospect I recognize the signs of prediabetes I had in my early twenties.

Long story short, I ended up going on a "diet" in my mid-twenties. For health reasons. And I tried a bunch of diets in futile attempts to control my symptoms, until I ended up with carnivore, which finally fixed it all. But it also showed me, for the first time in my life, that I had a problem.

*** Falling into a deep well
I have been carnivore for a bit over 4 years now, and I'm still learning more about my addiction and how to deal with it. During these 4 years, I had probably several hundred lapses and am still counting. Thankfully, I think I'm getting better at it.

Every time I manage to stay away from anything that tastes sweet (including anything with carbs and artificial sweeteners) the cravings go away slowly. And the longer I am without it, the less I crave it.

Yet it's enough with the tiniest smallest taste of sweetness and I'm lost. Suddenly, sweet treats are all I can think of and I want them so bad I could cry. Suddenly, I don't care that I will feel physically terrible for a few days if I eat it. Suddenly, nothing else matters anymore and I will be sneaking a sweet bite after a sweet bite, telling myself it's the last one and knowing that that is not true already before I swallow it.

For a long time, the only way I knew how to get out of this and just /stop/ was to have a binge. To eat as much candy as I wanted to. And while it would feel liberating and amazing, it also made me completely sick. Headaches, heartburn, bloat and diarrhea, sometimes vomiting, rashes and raging anxiety. Enough of a reminder and motivation to give me a chance to get out of it. 

It would take days of misery and cravings to get back to normal. If I managed at all. Often I would just fail again before I got there. 

It feels like falling into a well. One moment I am walking on a flat field, then I see a little dip in the ground and don't think much about it. But alas, it's not a little dip, it's a deep well. And climbing out of it takes days and the tiniest mistake makes me fall back down. A binge felt like letting myself sink to the rock bottom to use it as a springboard. But it was still a tough climb. When I would finally get out I could see the field ahead of me covered in wells...

*** Abstain or embrace the sugar life
I have quit sugar more times now than I can count. And the withdrawal period is the worst. It's a time of complete misery, cravings that are more about /need/ than /want/ and that consume all my thoughts. A time of heightened anxiety and physical discomfort.

The way I see it, I have two choices: abstain - completely and forever; or embrace the sugar life. And it's not really a choice. Because I can't get back on the path to diabetes, heart disease and dementia that I was on. Only when all of it disappeared, I realized how sick I actually was - gastrointestinal issues, skin issues, autoimmune issues, mental health struggles, obesity. And I know that is what would await me if I tried to go back to eating sweets. Because I just /can't/ moderate them. I have tried. Desperately. But the need to have more will always torture me until I give in. Or until I abstain long enough for it to go away.  

And as much as I love candy, I love the freedom of not wanting it much more.

*** Addiction is not simple
When I was young and stupid, I used to wonder how people could get/stay addicted to something. I didn't understand why anyone would willingly do something that was so bad for them. Ha! Now I know. I know better than I would like.

The carnivore diet is a wonderful tool in this fight, because it keeps me healthy, satiated and satisfied while being able to avoid everything sweet. It only takes 7-10 days for it to remove all the physical cravings. The mental ones though...

Addiction isn't just a chemical thing in the brain, it's not just about dopamine and neurotransmitters. It's about people, happiness, belonging, despair, coping,...

We know that even [[https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/add.14481][rats won't get addicted if they live in a "rat paradise"]], like they did in this study. And we know that [[https://doi.org/10.3109/00952997609014295][most of the soldiers who did drugs in Vietnam simply stopped when they returned home]]. There simply wasn't need for it anymore.

So I am slowly learning and discovering how I used sugar to deal with negative emotions and how I still want it when I feel down. I feel like I lost my crutch now and have to learn to walk on my own. It has been a long journey, and it's far from over, but I am getting better. I no longer binge after a small slip-up, I have learned to simply stop again, to not let myself fall all the way down into the well.

Maybe one day, there will be no wells. Maybe one day, I will even be able to moderate. But I have accepted that that might never happen, and I am OK with that. I gained much, much more than I lost by giving up sugar.

Have you ever seen a fat giraffe? No, me neither. Not even in a zoo. 

The fact that animals in the wild don’t get overweight is often chalked up to the fact that they get a lot of physical activity. But the same seems to apply to animals in zoos, in their miniature enclosures. 

Yet maintaining a healthy body weight is so difficult for us humans. And for a lot of animals living with us too, like our cats and dogs.

There are probably several magical ingredients in the soup of humanity that make us who we are; like big brains, opposable thumbs and a tendency to cooperate. And among these, we can definitely list our gait too.

The way we humans walk is unique in the natural world. Moving around on two legs freed up those opposable thumbs for other purposes, allowed us to throw things, carry things and use tools. It placed our heads higher up, allowing us to see further. It was an extremely successful adaptation that opened up an ocean of possibilities.

But, let's be honest, it's also an absolutely ridiculous way to stand. No engineer with a sane mind would even dream of designing something like this. Tall, lanky figures balancing on two small platforms. We are so used to seeing ourselves that we don't realize how unlikely this configuration is. And it's that much more magical that it works as perfectly as it does. The human gait definitely deserves an ode.

*** Learning to walk
Walking is a super basic skill for most animals. They are usually at it within minutes to days after being born or hatching. Not so us, humans. It takes about a year for a baby to crack the code and by then they are still very very far from running, jumping and standing on one leg. It takes several years for a child to master all the facets of human locomotion.

Working up to walking is a long process that starts way before the baby is ready to stand up. All the stages before that, from rolling, through lying on the belly propped up on bent arms, reaching, crawling and squatting, are important precursors to walking. They prepare the brain for the ultimate feat of using two feet to move around. They hone the basic movement patterns on which more complex movement is built, so that they become ingrained in our brains and bodies as automatic reactions. We learn about contra-lateral movement, about gravity, about stabilizing our core. We train the brain and we train the muscles. 

*** Every cat walks the same, every humans walks their own way
The path to walking is ready in our brains from the moment we are born. Just like all animals, we have the reflexes and the instincts; walking is in our DNA and our bodies know how to get there. But unlike most animals, it's a much more complicated process for humans that requires much more trial and error, testing, play and practice. There is really no need to teach a baby to walk, their biology will get them there. All they need is the right environmental inputs; which consist of a surface to move around on and people to interact with (and as little time spent in "containers" as possible).

Because gait is so much more complex for people than it is for animals, it can't be instinctual to the same level. While a cat or a giraffe will learn to walk in record time, simply following their instincts, we need to learn. The instincts are guiding us, showing us when we are on the right path, but we still have to walk it ourselves. And that's why -- unlike cats that all walk alike -- we don't.

When I was about 11, I started getting near-sighted. It took a while before anyone realized I wasn't seeing as well as I should, so I spent about a year looking at a blurry world. It was a bit tricky recognizing people from a distance. I just couldn't make out their faces. But one thing I could see from far away was the way they were walking, and I learned to tell all my family and friends apart by their gait. By their pace, the rhythm, the bounce, how their heels would strike the ground and how they would lift off, how their knees moved. I didn't learn it consciously, it just happened. And I never really stopped noticing.

People walk in such a huge variety of ways. The differences arise from learning under different circumstances, having slightly different bodies and different role models. They can be a result of injuries, small and big. It's fascinating how gait is something that adapts to the environment, but also how we subconsciously copy the people around us.

*** Walking is magic
I mentioned earlier that no sane engineer would have designed us this way, but that doesn't mean we are designed badly. It's just that we are designed based on principles that aren't commonplace in engineering. We are designed for mobility above else. We aren't a tower, we are more like a pendulum -- always in motion, moving closer and further to equilibrium. But a pendulum is not the perfect metaphor either. It captures the balancing and the constant oscillations about the equilibrium point, but a pendulum is a slave to gravity, which we are very much not. We play with gravity.

Did you know that you spend about 80% of your walking time standing on one foot? 80%! It's a lot, isn't it? That's why balancing is such a crucial skill, you literally need it to walk. Do you think your center of gravity moves from left to right when walking, in order to be right above the standing foot? It is tempting to think so. That would be the most stable position. But it doesn't. (Or at least, shouldn't.) It moves side to side slightly, but not nearly as far as being above the standing foot during the stride. Just think about how people walk; their hips and torso are not traveling side to side much at all. Yet, we don't keel over. That is because we have muscles that are holding us up, tensing in just the right places to make up for the pull of gravity.

We are not towers, and we are not pendulums. We are dynamic, living tensegrity structures.

Tensegrity (tensional integrity) is a term from architecture that describes structures built from two types of elements: hard rods that aren't directly connected to each other, and ropes that are holding them together. It's easier to understand from a picture.

#+attr_html: :alt A picture of a colorful toy made of sticks that are not touching each other, but are connected by a bunch of rubber bands.
#+caption: A kids' tensegrity toy. You know, start them early.

The hard rods are not compressible, while the ropes or rubber bands are providing tension that keeps them up, standing even when they look like they shouldn't. I always felt like they looked a little organic, a little magical, a little ethereal. And that is what we are too. A bunch of hard rods (bones) connected with rubber bands (tendons, ligaments, fascia and muscles).

It is a beautiful system that gives us incredible mobility and balance, while having all the stability we need. That is why our center of gravity doesn't have to be directly above the base of support (by which I mean the standing foot) when we are mid-step. The muscles on the outside of the thigh work like tensioned ropes and hold everything up against gravity.

There is even more to it. You probably don't realize it, but you are using your tendons and muscles like springs to store some of the energy of your step, so that they can release it, when it's their time to push you forward. We do it both when running and when walking, but the human gait is actually ridiculously efficient. [[https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.0703267104][We only use about a quarter of the energy that chimpanzees use for walking]] (whether they walk on two legs or four). We are pretty much made for it.  

*** Be a human -- walk
Walking is a full body exercise. To achieve that level of efficiency, to maintain balance and to be able to do it comfortably over a long time, much more of our body is involved than just the legs. The torso and the arms are doing a lot of work stabilizing and compensating for the rotation in the hips.

It shouldn't be surprising that walking is good for us. It is an input that our bodies evolved with and rely on to maintain themselves. Walking is important for bone density, to help with digestion and blood flow to the whole body, to keep the pelvic floor healthy, the butt strong and the hamstrings functional.

I know everyone always recommends to "just walk", or "at least walk" and we all think there is no point, because it doesn't do that much. But it really does. 

Walking is a wonderful form of movement; it's healthy, practical, pleasant and almost always available. If you have the privilege to be able to walk, I encourage you to use it.

:END:

I have been struggling with sugar addiction for years. It took its toll on both my physical and mental health long before I even knew I had it and I have been fighting it ever since I recognized its ugly face. And just like it tends to be with addictions, it was a very tough battle, and I wasn't always winning. I was ready to fight for the rest of my life, but now I think I might not have to. I think, carefully and hopefully, that I maybe, just maybe, might have won. How? Believe it or not, it was hypnosis.

*** What? Hypnosis?!
I wrote extensively [[https://noriparelius.com/post/blind-spot/][about my sugar addiction before]], so if you want to read more about the misery it brought me, just go ahead. This post will be about what liberated me.

I met Roger in a book club. (I really hope, Roger, that you don't mind me talking about this on my blog that nobody reads.) The most wonderful book club, full of lovely people from all around the world, that I feel genuinely lucky to have met. Roger is one of them -- a Scottish guy that just seems to radiate warmth, calm and wit. And as it happens, he runs a company selling hypnosis audio tracks. I remember when I found out about that a few months after joining the book club. "That's not something you hear often!" I thought, and pretty much left it at that.

At one of the book club meetings we were discussing mental health. It was one of those moments when you get to see that everybody really does have their own secret struggle, no matter the image they present to the world. Anyway, it was after that meeting that Roger recommended hypnosis to the rest of us. I knew very little about hypnosis and I never would have thought about it on my own, but getting a recommendation from someone whose opinion I have come to value, was enough to get me to try. 

Roger is one of the directors in a company called Uncommon Knowledge (I love the name!) and their [[https://www.hypnosisdownloads.com/][Hypnosis Downloads platform]] has thousands of audio tracks that you download and listen to whenever you feel like it. Literally thousands of short 20-30 minute sessions about anything and everything you could think of. (And by the way, this is not an ad, I'm getting nothing for this. I just genuinely love their stuff.)

*** You wouldn't give a cake to an itchy knee
I didn't know where to start, but I knew about at least one big problem I had. The damn sugar. So I started looking for hypnosis tracks that could help with that. I found a few and tried a few, downloads with names like Sweet Tooth and Food Addiction Help. I did as was recommended and listened to them every day for a week. They were nice, calming, lovely to listen to and I agreed with every word. But I didn't feel any different. I thought maybe I just needed to give it more time. Until I ran into the Stop Emotional Eating. It's funny, because I already knew that one of the reasons I was turning to "treats" was emotions; boredom, angst, loneliness, exhaustion, stress,... But knowing didn't help me to stop.

The first time I listened to Stop Emotional Eating felt like an emotional rollercoaster ride that ended with me disembarking into a new reality. I opened my eyes and wondered why on earth I ever tried to eat away my feelings. What an utterly stupid idea! As if that would ever work! It suddenly seemed completely silly and useless to eat an ice cream because I had a bad day (or a good one, for that matter). The hypnosis was full of deep insights and clever metaphors, and it reached a part of my mind no logic could ever penetrate to before. I still chuckle at the "You wouldn't give a cake to an itchy knee" whenever I think about it. Very true, I definitely wouldn't do that, but I spent decades doing its equivalent by putting a plaster made of chocolate over my feelings. No more though. No more.

*** Break the trance
Now, I was really feeling that my sugar struggles were over. And in some way they were! It's been a half a year and I didn't have a single binge in that time. What's even more, I didn't even want one, or get anywhere close. My emotions seemed to have detangled themselves from the food completely and permanently.

But. Oh yes, there is a but. I wasn't binging anymore, and I wasn't tortured by wanting something sweet more than anything, but kept nibbling at foods I knew would make me feel sick when nobody was looking. To be honest, I can't explain it. I would have a little bite of a banana pancake I made for my kids. Or a piece of blood sausage. Or an apple. All pretty good foods, but ones that unfortunately don't do me, personally, any good. I only did it when nobody was looking, while firmly telling myself that I don't want to do that, that it isn't worth it and that I don't even want it that much. I still did it. Over and over again. Mind-boggling. Thankfully, it didn't trigger the binges and I didn't really feel that unsatiable need for candy anymore.

I regret to say that it took me months to realize this was something else than the emotional eating I was partaking in before. It needed a different mind-shift. And lo and behold, I found a hypnosis for that too! Wanna guess? It's called Secret Eating. I only listened to that one once, about 6 weeks ago. And I haven't been grazing on things anymore. At all. And the best thing is that it is effortless. No willpower needed. Looking back, the moments I stole from my kids food felt like some sort of trance. My brain saw the opportunity, nobody was looking, so it didn't count. The reaction was almost automatic, no matter what I was trying to tell myself at that moment. The hypnosis broke the trance and put me back in control. 

*** Everyday magic
I know the word hypnosis sounds spooky and for quite a while after starting with it I felt a bit silly asking my husband to keep the kids away from me for twenty minutes, because I was going to do a... /hypnosis/. Truth is, there is nothing spooky or weird to it. It is actually a lot like what people call guided meditations now. You sit/lie down, relax, and listen to someone talking. No loss of control involved at all. You are completely free to disagree with whatever they are saying, or stop the track at any moment. In a sense, the whole experience doesn't feel special at all. No dangling watches, no whirlwinds in the eyes, no repressed memories, no waking up and realizing you were jumping around like a frog unbeknownst to you just seconds before. In that sense it's almost boring. 

But there is real magic to it too. I have told myself countless times before that eating something sweet would only make me feel sick and not actually calm the emotional storm I was drowning in. My thoughts never reached my feelings though. I have spent over 4 years trying to use willpower, tricks and hacks, trying to motivate myself, remind myself, rationalize and my progress was glacial at best. One single hypnosis session solving it all? That is a miracle.

*** Doesn't matter how you got there
What I really like about hypnosis, or at least the hypnosis from [[https://www.hypnosisdownloads.com/][Hypnosis Downloads]] / Uncommon Knowledge, is that it is always about the solution. There is rarely digging into what kind of trauma brought you were you are, because it doesn't really matter. The real question is how you get out.

I remember doing a "guided meditation" several years ago, which was all about meeting your demons and transforming them. It was a very cool experience, fairy-tale like and full of surprises. I met my sugar demon, a pink blobby creature with a funny hat. I talked to it, and could clearly see that what it was all about was hunger not for food, but for safety, connection, love and other things candy couldn't give. I got to see it for the coping mechanism it was. Then I  witnessed it transform from the monster into a hurt little me.

I don't know, maybe for some people that meditation would have been enough to leave the addiction behind. For me, it wasn't. It illuminated where I was and how I got there, but it also revealed to me what my addiction was doing /for/ me, why I /needed/ it. I didn't know how else to take care of those needs.

The Emotional Eating hypnosis was so much more pragmatic than the esoteric experience of meeting my demons. "You wouldn't give a cake to an itchy knee," is exactly what I needed to hear though. It didn't concern itself with why I was eating my feelings, which feelings, or where and when it might have started. What mattered was that it was an absolutely useless coping mechanism.

The hypnosis also offered a solution. A solution so painfully obvious, that it shouldn't need to be said, but for me, it was. I was told that I should take care of my emotional needs in the appropriate way, and only use food for hunger. Sounds vague, but in the days after I first listened to the track, I suddenly started becoming aware of my emotional needs that I didn't notice before. Now they were right there in front of me clear as day, and it felt ridiculous to shove a cookie in my face in a futile attempt to make them go away. 

*** A key to the mind
Ever since my first positive experiences with hypnosis, I have been turning to it almost daily, trying out various tracks.

I have been working on getting better at taking breaks, learning to compartmentalise my work and free time, let go of caring what others think about me, even getting better at creative writing! (I actually started writing a novel! Doing creative writing for the first time since high school! How fun is that?!)

Whenever I run into a problem in my life, a situation where I would wish I would feel and react differently, I look for the right track. It usually takes trying a few different, related ones, sort of like testing a bunch of keys on a stubborn lock. Sooner or later, one of them fits. Sometimes the change is slow and sneaky, sometimes it's like a lightning strike, but it is always, always, life-changing. 

If you find any of this intriguing, and you are wondering how hypnosis actually works, go and read about it from the experts. Here is a great article by Mark Tyrrell -- the other founder behind Uncommon Knowledge -- about [[https://www.hypnosisdownloads.com/blog/hypnosis-what-is-it-and-how-does-it-work][what hypnosis is]].

Humans are probably the only creatures in the world that are confused about what they should be eating.

Pandas eat bambus, koalas eucalyptys. Cows eat grasses and wolves eat meat. Most animals have a very limited menu. Yet humans are trying to eat "a varied diet", to "eat the rainbow". Something that wouldn't make sense for most animals on Earth.

What are we meant to eat? What is the natural human diet?

Team of scientist from Israel and Portugal tried to answer just that in [[https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/ajpa.24247][a study about the trophic level of our ancestors]] (in other words, where on the food chain our ancestors were).

*** Human omnivore -- but what else?
There is not much doubt about humans being omnivores. We can digest and use both plant and animal foods and the authors of the study are pointing to a number of archeological findings that show us eating both for a long time.

The real question though is, how much of what did we eat?

Most mammals are, just like us, omnivores, but most of these omnivores have strong preferences for either animal, or plant food. Even chimpanzees and wolves are in reality omnivores, altough wolves only eat plants if they have to, and chimpanzees indulge in animal foods only occasionally.

Where do humans fall on this scale?

*** The true paleo diet
How did our hunter-gatherer ancestors eat in the time between 2.5 million years ago and 12 000 years ago? If we can answer this question, we will get a much better idea of what our own bodies expect as fuel. The agricultural revolution started for only about 10 000 years ago, while our species -- Homo -- has existed in much the same form for more than 2 million years. That means that if Homo had emerged one hour ago, we would still have been hunters and gatherers just 20 seconds ago. The agriculture is still very much news for our genetics and our bodies.

So what did our ancestors hunt and gather?

*** Studied from every side
In this study, the authors looked at a great number of factors, parts of our physiology and genetics, archeological and paleontological finding, and etnographic evidence. They gathered almost 30 different clues showing how our ancestors were eating and how their menus evolved through the ages.

*** Man -- the fat hunter
In short, their conclusion was that since the birth of our genus Homo more than 2 million years ago, until the very recent times of about 15 000 years ago, we have mostly been eating the flesh of big mammals. Plants were a small addition to our diet -- most likely in the times when the hunt was not successful.

And not only we were mostly carnivorous, we actually ate as much fat as we could get our hands on. The main author of the study, Miki Ben-Dor called us "fat hunters". We know this, because the archeological and paleontological findings are showing that we were always going for the most fatty indviduals in the herd, even though they were more difficult to catch than the old and the sick ones.

Here I briefly summarize some of the other arguments showing we were predators of big animals:
- *high energy demands* -- humans require a lot of energy, and it would not have been possible for us to get all the calories we needed from plants (wild paleolitic plants -- modern produce bread for high sugar and starch yield would get us closer)
- *fat reserves* -- unlike other primates, we can store a considerable amount of fat on our bodies -- a necessity for when hunting wasn't successful
- *genetic adaptation to fat digestion* -- some of our genes that we share with chimpanzees have been turned off, to allow us to digest large amounts of fat
- *low stomach pH* -- our stomachs are more acidic than those of most carnivores; we have the pH of carion-eaters
- *intestinal system* -- our intestines resemble carnivores more than chimpanzees -- we have a long small intestine and short large intestine
- *insulin resistance* -- our response to insulin is less pronounced, more like that of carnivores
- *less chewing* -- compared to our very, very old ancestors who were still more similar to apes, already the paleolitic humans had a much less developed chewing muscles, which suggests they were eating soft foods -- meat and fat
- *a body adapted for hunt* -- since we evolved from apes, we didn't have a chance to inherit huge teeth or claws; instead, we got shoulders and arms that could learn to throw spears, and legs and stamina allowing for persistance hunting
- *a lot of small fat cells* - surprisingly, the size of the fat cells of an organism correlates very closely with their carnivory level; herbivores store their fat in a few big cells, while carnivores in many small ones -- ours are one of the smallest in the animal world
- *vitamins* -- compared calorie for calorie, animal foods are much denser in 8 out of 10 vitamins that humans require, in most cases several times more dense -- we would have had trouble getting all we needed from plants
- *social behaviour* -- food sharing, labour distribution and sharing the responsibility of raising the young are more common for predators
- *age at weaning* -- we differ a lot from other primates when it comes to the age of weaning -- other primates wean much, much later (at 4.5-8 years) than even the modern hunter-gatherer societies (around 2.5 years) -- it's common for carnivores to wean earlier than herbivores
- *longevity* -- we live much longer than our ape relatives -- maybe because the experience of elders was much more important for hunting and this evolutionary pressure favoured longevity
- *lack of dental cavities* -- for most of our history, cavities were very rare, they started appearing as we relied on plant foods more and more
- *analysis of radioactive istotopes* -- the analysis of paleontological finding suggests that we were at the trophic level of wolves up to about 15 000 years ago.

*** The world of our ancestors was different
The authors of the study also talk a lot about how we can't simply look at the diets of modern hunter-gatherers and believe our ancestors ate the same. The world has changed since, and we don't see the herds of woolly mammoths, mastodonts, nor bisons anymore. There are fewer species of big mammals on Earth now and even those remaining, like elephants, have low population numbers.

Modern hunters and gatherers have no chance to live the way they could have a million years ago. Maybe that is one of the reasons we are so confused about what we should eat. Our natural food source might not exist anymore. But thank gods we learned how to keep cows and make bacon.

*** More plants on the plate
How much plant matter we were eating was changing over the millenia. Eating meat, however, was what allowed us to develop our big brains and differentiate ourselves from our closest ape relatives. For a human to become a human, we had to be carnivores.

Plants started to take a bigger and bigger part in our diet about 15 000 years ago, so after about 2 million years of almost pure carnivory. This change was happening at a time when big mammals began to go extinct and this forced us to change our diets. Scientists can follow this change by looking at stable isotope analyses, appearance of tools made to process plants and more and more dental caries in the teeth of our ancestors at that time. Apart from cavities, this change also brought on a [[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/06/110615094514.htm][decrease in our average height and in the size of our brains]], and that is where we still are today. (I mean, we are shorter and with smaller heads than our genetically pretty much identical ancestors from 15 000 years ago. Crazy, isn't it?)

:END:

I believe this is my fifth(?!) attempt at blogging in the last 12 years. Some of those blogs were very short-lived, some survived for longer. None of the previous four are out there anymore. I had my reasons for starting each of the blogs, but it wasn't something I thought about much, not something that was clear in my mind. As I was starting yet another blog (this one), I decided to be a bit more mindful and conscious of what my goals actually are. Because if you don't know where you want to go, every step you take is in the wrong direction.

So here are my 5 reasons for blogging!

*** 1. Sorting out my thoughts
I think a bunch. This is not a brag, by the way, I am not saying that I think more than others, and I am definitely not so certain this is good for me. But the fact is that I think enough for it to often get crowded in my head. For my sanity, it's pretty useful to get those things out.

David McCullough said "Writing is thinking," and I very much agree with that sentiment. Writing helps me sort out my thoughts. Somehow, it's the best way for me to even find out /what/ exactly I am thinking. In a way, I never quite know what will come out of it when I start, but that is one of its best benefits to me. It allows me to clarify my thoughts to myself. 

While thinking itself can be passive, writing, on the other hand, is active. It gives the thoughts a concrete form, turns them from possibilities into /things/. Even if it's "only" words, those words are an act of creation. 

*** 2. Learning by explaining
Related to the previous point, explaining things, whether in writing or by talking through them, is one of the best ways to make sure that you understand things. Trying to put your knowledge into a digestible format that can be understood by others is one of the best ways to see where the gaps are, and it creates an incentive to fill them.

Richard Feynman was a big proponent of learning by trying to explain things to others It helped him finding out where he lacked knowledge, then he looked up what was missing, learned more and then did it all again. And again, and again. The Feynman technique (that is really what it is called) is just one of many within the "learning by teaching" framework. Even explaining things to an inanimate object improves learning, hence the existence of the "plastic platypus learning" technique (yes, that is its real name). (Now I kind of want a plastic platypus.)

*** Note
One might argue, that these first two points only require writing, and maybe a plastic platypus, but can be done without plastering the writing all over the internet. And that is true. There are countless ways to achieve these goals, but I like blogging, because knowing others might read what I write forces me to write it with much more care than I would just for myself or for a plastic platypus, however cute.  

*** 3. Getting better at writing
Does every teenager want to become a writer? I used to think so, then I asked a few people, and found out they don't. But I did. I also thought it was one of those silly dreams that you better not think too much about. How dumb is that?! Well, I finally got old enough and wise enough to realise that I might never be a /writer/, but there is nothing stopping me from being a writer. Nothing other than myself. Because making a living out of it is not at all required to being a writer. 

As it is with any skill, be it pottery or skiing or coding or decorating cakes to look like real objects, you get better at it by doing it. Quantity leads to quality.

There is a story about a photography class in which the teacher told half of the students that they will be graded solely on the quantity of the photographs they take, while the other group was supposed to only take one single picture -- a culmination of their knowledge, planning and preparations. At the end of the course, all the best photographs came from the "quantity" group. Absolutely all of them.

I read this story first in Atomic Habits by James Clear, then again in Show Your Work! by Austin Kleon, but this time with pottery instead of photography. [[https://austinkleon.com/2020/12/10/quantity-leads-to-quality-the-origin-of-a-parable/][Austin Kleon investigated why there are two versions of this story]], and found out it really did happen in a photography class, but was first told by David Bayles and Ted Orland in the book Art & Fear, and they felt it fit better when changed to pottery.

I feel like the story works perfectly well with both photography and pottery, and the two versions of it illustrate how universal it actually is. Quantity doesn't trump quality, but it does lead to it.

And so my goal is to practice my writing.

*** 4. Gathering memories
This is a point I haven't reached yet. I have deleted my old blogs, although I do keep some of my favourite old articles in my own archives. But I am looking forward to one day browsing through things I wrote 5, 10 or 20 years ago. Reminding me how my life was back then, what I was thinking about. Some of it will definitely feel outdated, maybe even cringe, but I think it will be fun.

*** 5. Connecting with other people
Lastly, I want to publish my writings so that others can read them.

I often doubt whether my writing makes any sense, whether anyone wants to read it at all, whether I should just give up and climb under a rock. But life is too short and too weird for (self-)censorship, so I am doing my best to work around those doubts.

Truth is, I want people to read what I write. I want to know what they think. I want to test my ideas by showing them to others. I want to share the things I discovered, that make my life better or bring me join. I hope I might help someone, or inspire them, even if I only inspire them to prove me wrong on something.

Now that I am thinking about it, my blogging already turned a distant acquaintance into one of my now best friends. (Shoutout to Mariš!) I don't see where and how we would have gotten to know each other if I didn't step out of my comfort zone and started writing. So I guess it is working.

*** What I didn't mention
An attentive reader might notice that I didn't talk about some things that many people nowadays aim for when starting a blog. There are no mentions of traffic, marketing, or growth. In short, no money.

Let's not sand-paper our eyes, who wouldn't want some extra money, right? (Btw, sand-papering your eyes is a great Slovak expression for denying the obvious. I am trying to introduce it to English. Is it working?) Anyway, yes, money.

Truth is, the last blog before this one was my attempt to start an online business. And I hated it. It was fun at first, then it wasn't. I wrote a whole [[https://noriparelius.com/post/i-failed-at-starting-an-online-business/][blog post about how I failed at starting an online business, and why I'm happy with that]]. I still think it's super neat that people can make money online, and I definitely believe that creators should be paid for what they do and provide. But the way I was trying to go about it just didn't feel right for me.

Thankfully, I don't need to make money from blogging, and I have a bunch of other wonderful reason for pursuing it. I am very happy to just blog for fun, as a hobby, about whatever I want. Simply to enrich my life, and maybe, if I am lucky, someone else's too.

:END:

It is almost a tradition for people who get hooked on Zettelkasten to write a blog post about it. After using it for a year, I think it is about time I followed this tradition and added my experiences.

I have always been a note-taker. I feel a strong urge to capture thoughts, events and ideas that are important to me. Over the years, I have been using a bunch of apps, paper notebooks, different kinds of files and folder systems to try to keep some order in my notes. No matter how hard I tried though, it always ended up being a mess, sooner or later. I think I sort of accepted that as an inevitable part of life. That notes were temporary -- only good for helping me acquire the knowledge, but useless for long term storage. Now all of that changed with Zettelkasten.

*** What is a Zettelkasten
There are much better explanations of what a Zettelkasten is and how it works than I could put together here. One of the very best ones is [[https://zettelkasten.de/introduction/][Introduction to the Zettelkasten Method on zettelkasten.de]], so if you want a proper in depth introduction, head over there. ([[https://zettelkasten.de][zettelkasten.de]] is hands-down the best resource about all thinks Zettelkasten and they have a great forum too.)

In short, a Zettelkasten is a way of note-taking based on creating a network of interconnect thoughts/notes. It can be done both physically, the old-school way with a filing cabinet full of paper slips (Zettelkasten is German for "slip box"), or digitally with the many note-taking apps and software solutions available. The only things necessary are a way of uniquely identifying and finding each note and a way to implement bidirectional links. 

Using index cards for note-taking used to be a pretty common thing. However, what most people mean when they talk about a Zettelkasten nowadays is a bit more specific.

Modern Zettelkästen (that is plural for Zettelkasten), are inspired by the work of Niklas Luhmann, a 20th century German sociologist who built a Zettelkasten of about 90,000 cards and used it to help him write over 50 books and 550 articles. He also wrote a book about his practice, called Communicating with Slip Boxes.

Sönke Ahrens brought new attention to the Zettelkasten method in his [[https://www.soenkeahrens.de/en/takesmartnotes#zettelkasten-en][book How to Take Smart Notes]], where he explains what a Zettelkasten is and how to use it.


*** The basic principles of a Zettelkasten
What makes a bunch of notes into a Zettelkasten, is 3 basic principles.

1. *Atomic notes*.
   
   Each note should contain one piece of knowledge only. Now, personally, I find this principle to be the most difficult to follow, because I am often not sure what counts as "one piece of knowledge", although I am getting better at it with practice. There is usually a sweet spot for how granular the notes can be and thanks to the flexibility of digital tools, it's not that difficult to split up notes that have grown a bit too much.
   The note atomicity is important to facilitate the second principle, which is:
2. *Links between notes*.
   
   You make links between notes by referencing them. It's sort of like a wiki, but with atomic notes. This way, it is possible to link to one note from many other notes, making connections between loads of different ideas.
3. *Writing with own words*.
   
   The last principle is about writing the notes with your own words rather than copying straight from the source. This forces you to process the thoughts, and to make them your own. It is also important to write the notes "properly", so they can work on their own. You need to have the audience in mind, which in this case is your future self that has forgotten everything about this idea.

*** A system meant to grow
My problem with notes has always been that at some point they become unmanageable. Truth is, I didn't have much of a system at all. I tried to organise them, of course. Folders within folders of difficult to navigate hierarchies always inevitably became a mess where finding whatever I was looking for was almost impossible.

For me, notes were mostly a learning aid, I used them to prepare for exams and finish projects, but once that was over, they would lie forgotton. Whenever I would try to get back to them months or years later, needing to refresh some of that knowledge, I found them too telegraphic, not giving enough context and explanations, lacking, disorganized and hard to navigate. I would usually toss them at that point, disappointed over the waste of time and effort that went into taking them.

When I first heard about Zettelkasten last January, I was intrigued. Now, a year and almost 500 notes later, I can say it works.

Instead of trying to organise notes hierarchically into hard-to-navigate folders, all of my notes are in a single folder. Instead of trying to write notes as comprehensive as possible, each note is dedicated to one thought -- one idea, that I try to capture as best I can in the title. 

It is easy to make a new note, because I don't have to immediately think about where to file it. It simply goes into The Folder. It is equally easy to find it later by a simple keyword search of the files.

My previous methods to organise notes were rigid, top-down approaches trying to fit things into a predetermined structure. The moment something unexpected showed up, the structure had nowhere to grow, the only thing I could do was tear it down, redesign the structure, and start again.

A Zettelkasten, on the other hand, only gets /better/ with more and more notes. There is no predetermined structure, no hierarchy, all the notes are on an equal footing, as are all the ideas and topics. The structure emerges on its own from the notes themselves. If we really are learning, what we learn is bound to surprise us. Trying to define a structure for our note collection beforehand is like trying to come up with a conclusion before we did the research. That is at best inconvenient and at worst deeply unscientific. A Zettelkasten allows us to capture all that is relevant to a topic, not only what fits the predetermined narrative.

A Zettelkasten grows organically, bottom up.

*** A place to think
As I already talked about in [[https://noriparelius.com/post/my-reasons-for-blogging/][a blog post about my reasons for blogging]], David McCullough said "Writing is thinking," and I very much agree. Putting words to paper (or even just saying them) forces us to give the thoughts and ideas actual form, taking them from the level of abstract possibilities into reality. Sometimes I feel like I need to write to even find out what exactly I am thinking.

A Zettelkasten is a perfect companion where a lot of this writing/thinking can happen. It demands that I formulate my thoughts clearly, trying to extract the atomic ideas from whatever I am thinking and express them fully in my own words.

The magic of Zettelkasten is in the links though. Making sure that a new note gets integrated into the network means I have to think about it in context, look at related ideas, write about the connections between them and revisit old notes. It allows my present me to interact with what my old me has been thinking and writing.

A lot of the thinking happens in the so-called structure notes (or map-of-content notes) where we can bring together a number of ideas and connect them into something new, linking to the individual notes. These notes allow us to take a step back, look at the bigger picture and integrate ideas rather than breaking them down.

*** Zettelkasten is a real Memex
Memex -- short for memory expander -- is a fictional machine from a 1945-book "As we may think" by Vannevar Bush (which I haven't read, actually, just heard about). Memex organises a user's thoughts and semi-automatically brings related ideas together. A number of bloggers were inspired by memex, among them one of my favourites -- Cory Doctorow ([[https://pluralistic.net/2021/05/09/the-memex-method/][his blog post about The Memex Method]]). 
Memex might be fictional, but Zettelkasten does what memex sets out to do. It is a way to organise one's thoughts and provide a framework for connecting them. 

The godfather of Zettelkasten, Niklas Luhmann, talked about his Zettelkasten more as a writing partner than a mere tool. One would almost get the impression that his Zettelkasten was alive.

At this point, my Zettelkasten has almost 500 notes, and I have been using it almost daily for a year. Despite that, I am definitely still just a beginner Zettelnaut (a wonderful word that, as far as I know, comes from Will at the zettelkasten.de forum). My Zettelkasten is very much not alive, but I can imagine that when it grows to several tens of thousands of notes, it would hold more than my brain is capable of, and then it would surely have some surprises for me. I am already looking forward to that. 


*** Making a mosaic
For me, reading books has become so much more intentional. That is where the majority of my Zettelkasten inputs come from. I read, and I take notes and I connect the new ideas to the old ideas, finding unexpected connections that deepen my understanding and refine my thinking. And it's fun (I think we have already established that I have weird ideas about fun).

I find Zettelkasten to be freeing, because it lowers the threshold for taking notes. I don't have to think about where to put the note, or whether it is important enough to write down. Time will tell. That is one of the most exciting things about a Zettelkasten -- seeing where my interests are. It is like watching topics crystalize out of the dense soup of ideas, or grow like mushrooms from a rich mycelium, or like images showing themselves when you take a step back from painstakingly building a mosaic. 


*** Who is it for
I do enjoy working with my Zettelkasten and find it useful and enriching. But I don't think everyone needs one. Zettelkasten requires a fair amount of work, and it is not a magic pill that will output great new ideas on its own. In the end, it really is just a way of taking and organising notes.

I think it can be a great tool/companion for anyone doing research, be it scientists, non-fiction writers, journalists, students or bloggers.

*** My Zettelkasten set up
This last part is very much only for people who want to start a Zettelkasten and are curious about other people's set up. I know I was, when I was starting out. The most important thing I can say though, is that you do you.

When setting up my Zettelkasten, I followed these principles:
1. *Principle precedes procedure*.
   
   I wanted to make sure that how I do things and what I do isn't decided by the tools I have available, but rather by the principles I want to implement (such as the Zettelkasten principles). You wouldn't first get a hammer and then go around looking for things to smash with it.

2. *Prioritise longevity*
   
   The idea of having one Zettelkasten for the rest of my life really appealed to me (I am like a dragon, I like to sit on treasures). Trying to increase the chances that my notes will survive half a century is not completely trivial though.

3. *Keep it simple*
   
   A principle on its own, but also a consequence of the previous two. Keeping it simple to make it as easy as possible to take notes, maintain the system, move it to a different software and so on.
 
I started my Zettelkasten in Obsidian and within two months moved it to org-roam in Emacs. I still think Obsidian is a great piece of software and there was nothing wrong with it. The reason I switched was that I wanted something non-proprietary and open source, and something that might survive for a while. Emacs gets a lot of extra points for the longevity.

Another reason I left Obsidian behind is the amount of cool plugins it provides. While they were very tempting, I ultimately didn't want to be adding unnecessary complexity to something that can (and should) be fairly simple.

When I switched to Emacs, I was an Emacs newbie and the learning curve was steep and fun (as I said, I have a weird idea of fun), but also absolutely maddening and at one point I was even wondering whether everyone who claims to like Emacs is just a victim of Stockholm Syndrome and Sunken cost fallacy. Anyway, I got over the hump, set things up the way I like them, and haven't tinkered ever since.

Would I recommend Emacs to others? Well, if you have some coding basics, love to tinker, are stubborn as hell and like to disappear into rabbit holes, then maybe. If not, there are a lot of nice Zettelkasten software solutions that work with plain text files, so if you are worried about longevity, you know that you can still open your notes if your software disappears. One thing to remember though might be to try not to rely on super fancy features that you might not find elsewhere.

To reduce friction of creating notes and of possible future software transfers, I am trying to keep my metadata to a minimum.

I use a datetime stamp in the title of the note files, which tells me when the file was created. All my zettels are in one folder only, but I have two additional folders, that are adjecent to the Zettelkasten, but not quite part of it. I call these inputs and outputs.

Inputs might be called "fleeting notes" by some. In my workflow, these are the files where I take notes from whatever I am reading or watching. I will use one file per book, for example, so these notes are not atomic in any way. Then I go through them and extract the ideas that I want to make proper zettels out of.

My Zettelkasten is for me only, and would probably provide little value for anyone else. Whenever I want to make something for others, I put the draft into the "outputs" folder, where I can still link to the proper notes, but hold these compositions separate.

I am not much of a tagger, and other than #MOC (for map of content), I don't use other tags. Yet. Instead, I rely on links and structure notes (MOCs) to help me find things and orient myself. Categories provide only weak associations and things like tags don't scale very well. Sooner or later, you will find yourself with too many tags and too many notes per tag. But we will see, maybe there will come a time when I will decide to add tags to my zettels. 

I use pretty much a standard org-roam setup for my Zettelkasten, with quite a few elements inspired by [[https://jethrokuan.github.io/org-roam-guide/][the org-roam setup of Jethro Kuan]] who made org-roam.

I use Zotero to keep my references and Better BibTex to export them into a single .bib library. 
To then insert the references into the notes, I use citar and citar-org-roam packages.

I use capture templates for zettel, input, output and reference notes. A reference note is an input note that is linked to a bibliography entry. The capture template will put the note into the correct folder, create a filename with a datetime tag and put the title into the note. The filename also includes -I- for input notes and -O- for output notes and the capture template adds an "input" or "output" tag to input and output notes. 

#+begin_src elisp 
;; ORG-ROAM
(use-package org-roam
	     :ensure t
	     :custom
	     ;; setting up the directory

	     (org-roam-db-autosync-mode t)

	     )
#+end_src

This part modifies the display template to show the tags associated with the note.
#+begin_src elisp
(setq org-roam-node-display-template (concat "${title:*} " (propertize "${tags:20}" 'face 'org-tag)))
#+end_src


I use a completely standard setup for citar:
#+begin_src elisp 
;; CITAR
(use-package citar
  :ensure t
  :custom
  (setq org-cite-global-bibliography "/home/nori/Documents/TheNotes/biblio.bib")
  (citar-bibliography "/home/nori/Documents/TheNotes/biblio.bib")
  (org-cite-insert-processor 'citar)
  (org-cite-follow-processor 'citar)
  (org-cite-activate-processor 'citar)
  :bind
  (:map org-mode-map :package org ("C-c b" . #'org-cite-insert))
  )
#+end_src

Citar org roam allows me to use my roam capture template to make a note from a reference. When I run =citar-open=, I can choose a bibliography entry for which I want to create an org-roam note following my 'reference' capture template. 
#+begin_src elisp
;; CITAR-ORG-ROAM
(use-package citar-org-roam
  :ensure t
  :after citar org-roam

:END:

We live in the age of social media. So much of our interactions, information sharing, news acquiring and entertainment happens there. Yet many of us have a somewhat (or very) mixed relationship with them. And rightly so. When you think about it, it is the strangest thing. We go there to see things we (mostly) didn't choose ourselves, served to us in small bite-sized bits: /-- an interesting fact! -- a sad story :( -- an update from a "friend" you haven't talked to in 12 years -- a funny video! -- a scary thing you should look out for!!! --/ Before you get the time to digest one, you move onto the next. Over and over again. Scroll, scroll, scroll. There are so many good things social media have given us, and I love them for that. But today, I am once again choosing to take a break from them, because of all the bad things they do to my brain.

*** All the world's woes
Admittedly, I am not very good at knowing myself. It often takes me 24+ hours to figure out how I feel about things. Today, I had a bad day. I have been feeling exhausted, fragile, weepy, upset by the smallest things. Every little disruption to my day would leave me feeling off-balance for way longer than it warranted. Why? Well, that's the most annoying thing. I had no idea. No idea whatsoever. I knew something was wrong, but didn't know what. (In such cases I usually assume it's me that is wrong, which, understandably, doesn't help much.) It took the better part of the day, but eventually, I figured it out (with ample help from people who love me). As usual, it's not just one thing, but today, the biggest one was over-saturation of difficult things I have been watching and reading.

Never in the history of humanity did people have the ability to know so much, to such detail, about events happening on the other side of the world. And, sadly, it's so much more common to hear about the terrible events happening on the other side of the world, rather than the happy ones. I understand that. These things are important. Raising awareness is important. But let's be honest, what can /I/ do about these events that are so much bigger than me? What can /I/ do about wars and genocides, about discrimination, about corporate greed, about large-scale pollution, about species loss, about babies dying, about suffering, about scientific fraud, about famines, about about about? 

Don't get me wrong, there are always things that can be done, and there are a lot of people doing them, but no one person could take on all of it. So the thing I end up doing about these terrible things most of the time is, simply, feel sad and helpless. And that doesn't help anyone at all.

*** When do I get the time to process this?
In a true Nori-fashion, I haven't been quite aware how much these things were affecting me. When I would get a few minutes of time when nothing was happening, or I felt like I needed a distraction, I would reach for the little box and scroll and scroll and scroll. And at some point I would realise that in the background, I had a thought. Or maybe a feeling. I would be thinking: /oh, that was interesting, should learn more about that/; but I didn't remember what /that/ was. Or I would feel a bit sad or upset, sort of in the back of my mind; but I didn't remember what about. And more often than not, I would think and feel several things at the same times. Sometimes I would even scroll back, trying to identify what it was that stayed with me. There was rarely only one thing.

There is so much good content on social media, with so many people putting in a lot of effort to deliver an important, concise message, or to provide entertainment for a moment. They know they don't have more than a few seconds of our attention, because we are about to scroll on and never see their post again, so they pack it as full as it gets. Every bite now carries the calories of a three-course dinner. That is the actual design of these platforms. A new topic every second or two.

I don't know how about you, but I am often left with a mix of impressions, ideas, thoughts and feelings, fighting for my attention, fuzzy in my mind, yet following me around relentlessly.

What is more, most of us go to these platforms in the small bits of time when what we are seeking is a mental break. A little breathing room for the mind. If I am honest with myself, I definitely do not come back from them with a clear head. 

*** Why am I scrolling?
Why am I there though? 

I think the answer, as usual, is complex. I genuinely like and appreciate a lot of the content I run into, both from people I chose to follow and from people that the algorithm decided to show me. And that is the main reason I am there. But of course, there is a lot of content that I get served that I do not care for much, or even actively dislike. Stumbling upon a good post feels like winning (a small) lottery. And "good", in this case, doesn't just mean something that fits my interests. It means something that resonates with me /right now/, that I feel in the mood for /right now/. 

It's definitely a little dopamine hit.

But there, right behind the edge, could lie another gem. Something that might be even more interesting/entertaining/surprising/funny/eye-opening. Maybe, maybe not. The pull of it is magnetic, and sometimes I scroll before I had the time to finish reading the previous "gem".

How naive of me, though, to not consider that all of these, the hits and the misses both, affect me? That maybe I shouldn't be exposing my brain to that much unrelated, varied information whenever I get an idle minute? And for what? Finding something interesting or funny or cool or useful and not even giving myself the time to process it properly? For spending my time and energy on things I will hardly remember five minutes later?

*** Who/what decides what we see?
In the old days of social media, you knew what you would get. Mostly. You followed people because you wanted to see what they were posting, and expected to be shown exactly that. Nowadays, that is usually not the case. Most platforms offer a mix of things you did ask for, along with a bunch of posts you didn't ask for. Usually ads. Or sponsored content, as they call it nowadays.

Everyone nowadays knows that the end users of social media aren't their customers. The true customers are the advertisers, we -- you and me -- the end users -- are the product that the platforms are serving them.

But it actually went even further. While advertisers might be the paying customers, that doesn't mean they are being treated well. Quite the opposite, they are being asked to pay more and more just to have their content delivered to people who have already /signed up/ to see that content. The goal is not to make a good product for the end users, not even for the advertisers, it's to maximise the profit for the shareholders.

How are they getting away with it? They got us all trapped. Our friends are there, the people we want to hear from are there, our pictures and memories are there, and in the case of the advertisers, their customers are there. And the platforms ride the thin line of serving us as many ads as possible without actually driving us away; and extracting as much money from the advertisers and publishers as possible without them giving up on the platform.
Cory Doctorow calls this process "enshittification" (what a wonderful name, isn't it?) and talks about it, and more, both on his blog [[https://pluralistic.net/2023/10/14/freedom-of-reach/][pluralistic.net]] and in his book The Internet Con. Very much recommended.

Nobody likes ads, but that is the main way that social media platforms make money. In order to keep us there, and show us those ads, they need to offer something engaging. The trouble is, engaging doesn't necessarily mean positive, or true for that matter.

As humans, we are wired to notice things that are wrong, dangerous, or scary. It makes sense from a survival point of view -- to pay extra attention to whatever could harm us. But in many cases nowadays the danger is very far away, highly unlikely, exaggerated, or even imaginary. We still get upset and angry about it just the same. And it gets our attention, our reactions, comments and likes and replies. It makes us look, which is what the platforms want, but it doesn't make us happy.

Social media have been facilitating polarisation in societies all over the world. I am not going to go as far as to say that they /did/ it themselves, because I don't think they ever thought about that. I think it's a side effect of algorithms that are trying to maximise time spent on the platform. Nothing draws people more in than feeling like a part of a group and having a /them/ to blame all the problems on.

Social media are echo chambers, where we get to hear what we want to hear, often the things that make our blood boil and enrage us. Because /we/ are on the right side, and /they/ are obviously not. The truth is, there is no /they/. There are just people.

*** Being intentional

Now that I (finally) realised that these small, innocent-looking bits of the world are using up a lot of my mental space and affecting how I feel, I decide to be much more intentional about them.

I think it's time that, when I get a moment of time I feel the need to fill out, I might as well fill it out with something I actively decided to engage with. Something that is made to keep my attention for more than a quick glance. Or maybe, just maybe, spend some time with my own thoughts. An actual moment to clear my mind.

I am not quitting social media. There is too much there that I value for me to quit. But I do not need to engage with them multiple times a day. Not even every day, really. Probably not even every week. Social media are great for finding interesting things, but real learning and understanding requires a bit more time, and a bit more attention. And entertainment deserves that kind of space too! I will try to prioritise longer form writings and videos. There are plenty amazing books, audiobooks, long videos, comprehensive blog posts and podcasts that cover all the topics under the sun.

And I have recently even rediscovered RSS feeds! They still exist! I have one too, BTW. Just saying. Or you can sign up for the newsletter below.

I think it's time we started to protect our attention and our mental energy, whether it is getting drained by social media or anything else.

As a civilisation, we seem to be painfully aware of all the shortcomings in our contact with nature. Stories about all we have destroyed, and where we have failed, permeate our culture. Truth is, we don't even believe anymore that we could do any good. Most of us feel like the best thing we could do for nature, is to leave it alone. But that kind of thinking is wrong. And dangerous.

*** How can we do good, if we can't even imagine it?
If I asked you how humans are affecting the nature, I suspect you would tell me about all the bad things we are doing. About the pollution, the deforestation, about the insecticides and herbicides, about microplastics, and mining, and species loss. And you would, of course, be right.

But is that all of it? Is destruction all we are capable of?

Most of us actually do think so. Growing up in our culture, we absorb the image of pristine nature and of the horrible effect we, the humanity, have on it. We talk about nature and wilderness as something pure and good -- and completely separate from us. We think the best we can do is to leave it alone.

If we can't even /imagine/ that our interactions with the rest of the natural world could be beneficial for it, how can we hope to actually /do/ anything positive?

How are we supposed to find a way to live on this planet in peace and harmony with the rest of the life on it, if we assume from the get-go that we are only capable of doing harm? How are we supposed to be looking for solutions, if we don't actually believe there are any?

I was thinking about all this as I was reading George Monbiot's book /Regenesis/. While he had some good points, I found myself strongly disagreeing with his conclusions and solutions. I might write about it more some day, but not today.

I think George Monbiot got it wrong from the premise. For him, the number one problem of agriculture is land use. And so his solution is to use as little land as possible. Everything he suggests is considered from this point of view, arriving at dubious solutions such as using factory-grown bacteria as the chief source of fat and protein for people around the world.

It is clear that George Monbiot can't imagine that humans could actually be useful to the rest of the natural world. And he definitely can't see us as a part of it. He takes it even further, and as many of his fellow vegans, he even sees domestic animals as inherently damaging to nature and something that should be removed. It's as if cows and sheep and other domestic animals have lost their status as part of nature in his eyes. It's as if they were tainted by their contact with us.

*** Humans are nature too
We have been thinking of ourselves as separate from nature for a while now. The concept of nature came to be after the Middle Ages, during the period of Enlightenment. It is even more recent to think of ourselves as only being capable of natural destruction. But thankfully, our culture does not represent all the people in existence and definitely not all the people in history. We might have forgotten about it, but the truth is that humans /can/ live in peace with nature. And not only that, we can even help it prosper.

One of the main ideas in the (absolutely wonderful) /Ishmael/ trilogy by Daniel Quinn is the fact that humanity is much, much older than our civilisation. While it's a fact fairly obvious to most of us, it has some implications that we don't usually realise.

Our genus, Homo, is almost 3 million years old. Homo sapiens -- modern humans, that were anatomically and physiologically identical to us -- appeared some 300 000 years ago. Compared to either of these numbers, our agriculturalist, city-building, less than 10 000 years old civilisation, is like a blink of an eye. Humans have been here for a long time, living just like all other creatures do -- as part of the ecosystem. 

We tend to think about our prehistoric ancestors as not-quite-human; as if they were somehow unfinished. We assume they didn't have our curiosity, our intellect and our drive, because in our eyes they were not yet living the way humans are supposed to. Yet, they were just like us, and  yet they managed to live in peace with the world around them.

They knew they belonged to the world, just as much as rhinos and mites and sequoias do; and they knew that just like any of those other creatures, they had their role to play in it.

How can we know what they might have been thinking? Well, fortunately, there are still people living in this world now, whose lifestyle is closer to that of our hunter-gatherer ancestors than to our "civilised" ways. We still have a chance to learn from them. If we are ready. 

*** Myth of the wilderness
The truth is that Indigenous peoples have been modifying and managing the nature around them for millennia. Many of the areas that we would classify as wilderness were shaped by human activity, including places such as the Amazon rain-forest, or the Australian aridlands. While this is still far from the mainstream perception, scientist are actually starting to point to how the whole concept of "wilderness" is inappropriate and how certain biomes rely on human input for their preservation (great article on this is [[https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2022218118][Indigenous knowledge and the shackles of wilderness]]).

*** Picking sweetgrass
In her beautiful, gentle book /Braiding Sweetgrass/, Robin Wall Kimmerer -- a Native American botanist -- reveals a lot about how her culture approached the natural world. She talks about the sense of belonging and feelings of community with all the life around them. She talks about the Honorable Harvest, which is a set of rules to make sure that people don't take more than their fair share, and that enough is left to keep the cycles of nature going. (Rules like: Never take more than a half. Never take the first, nor the last. Take only what you need. Always give back in return.)

From her stories it becomes clear that the bounty of the land that the European colonisers encountered when they first arrived to the Americas was not an accident. It was not wilderness. It was the result of many millennia of careful cultivation at the hands of the Indigenous peoples.

One of the moving examples she gives, is that of sweetgrass. This plant was, and still is, used for ceremonial purposes among her people and is very important to them. Unfortunately, the sweetgrass populations are steadily declining. Various tribes have different ways of harvesting sweetgrass, and everyone, understandably, thinks their way is the better one. Robin Wall Kimmerer enlisted one of her botany master students to do a thesis about the sweetgrass harvest, trying to determine which harvesting technique was better for the plants -- either pulling it out with its roots, or cutting it off, leaving the root in the soil.

She had trouble convincing the faculty to approve the study. They thought it rather useless, saying the result was known from the beginning, as it was obvious that harvesting would lead to decline regardless of the method. But nobody expected what actually happened.

The student spent two years harvesting from three different sweetgrass patches (following the rules of the Honorable Harvest) and documenting the results. She would pinch some of the grass from one of them, pull it out from the other, and the third one was left as a control. At the end of the study period, only one of those patches was not doing well, its population declining. It was the control patch.

As it turns out, sweetgrass needs to be picked. If it isn't, if space isn't made for new plants, they get smothered under the tall growth. The decline of sweetgrass goes hand in hand with the disappearance of the peoples who value and harvest it. And the patches that still thrive are, not surprisingly, located in the areas where the people still live and interact with them. 

*** The ciiiircle of liiife
We often feel like it's somehow morally wrong to be eating other living beings. We are sceptical to the beneficial effects that predators have on their ecosystems, and completely blind to the benefits they provide to their prey (not on the individual, but on the community level).

Lions picking out a sick zebra can save the herd from a disease spreading. Chasing the zebras around ensures they don't spend too much time in one place, which protects the land from overgrazing, and the zebras from getting parasitic infections from infected manure of their buddies.

Big herds of grazing animals are what prevents grasslands from turning into deserts or forests. The shrubs and trees get eaten before they get a chance to grow big, and the grass gets thinned to make space for new growth, fuelled by the fertiliser left behind by the animals. Some ruminants, like the buffalo, even have an enzyme in their saliva that stimulates grass growth.

While there is nothing wrong with forests, grasslands are a different ecosystem, supporting an equally diverse network of plants and animals that can not thrive in a forest. Despite people who call for "rewilding", and believe that the only valid landscape is a forest, grasslands have always been here. There is now even [[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2023/11/231114143742.htm][evidence that about half of Europe was covered by grasslands and meadows /before/ the arrival of modern humans]]. But just like in the case of sweetgrass, the European grasslands now rely on us to help them thrive. 

In the end, everyone eats and is eaten. Microbes, fungi and plants feed on death just as much as herbivores and carnivores do. Being lower on the food chain does not make one more virtuous. And being higher up on it does not prevent one from contributing to the community of life. Every ecosystem is a network where everything is attached to everything and each creature is needed, however cute or yucky or weird. 

*** You find what you are ready to look for
I have been reading (and thinking) a lot about agriculture lately. It is our closest and most important point of contact with the cycles of life and of nature. It definitely seems like we got a lot of it wrong, and we need to make some changes.

I think it is important that we look for solutions with the right mindset. It is difficult to notice things that you aren't looking for, let alone ones you can't even fathom. I think it's time we started looking at ourselves as creatures that /do/ belong in this world, and that /can/ work with it, care for it, and protect it, while receiving what we need to live. We have to believe it is possible first, before we can even start finding out how to do it. Thankfully, we humans are fast learners, and we still have someone to learn from. And while there is no going back to the Stone Age (not that I want to), we can surely find a way to practice some Honorable Harvest in our world.

The change, if it happens, will come from the bottom. From people with a new vision. From people like you and me.

:END:

When I was young, I used to think farming was boring. Totally uninteresting, kinda dumb, even. Oh, how I cringe, embarrased, when I think about that old and dumb me. Now I know better. Because when you really, really think about it, farming is one of the most important things anyone could ever do. And it seems we got it pretty wrong.

*** The agriculture is not working
Thanks to the book club I am participating in (video about our book club), I have been reading a lot about agriculture lately. The question of how we can feed the world without overwhelming our plantet's resources is a big and important one. And definitely not simple.

Agriculture definitely plays a big part in the harms we as a society are causing to the planet and ourselves. The use of pesticides, herbicides, synthetic fertilisers and heavy machinery to till and harvest is destroying the soils, polluting our waters and poisoning, killing and displacing wildlife. Farm animals often live in terrible conditions in large-scale feeding operations, where their manure is piling up becoming an environmental hazard, instead of what should have been a life-giving fertiliser. The people who produce our food  are often among the poorest people in the society, often exposed to chemicals that have devastating health effects. As if that wasn't enough, certain markets (like chocolate) are directly built on slavery. 

*** It's the how, not the what
There are a lot of people who will argue that we should get rid of farm animals to save the climate and the environment. On closer inspection, this idea holds no water whatsoever.

Animals, cows especially, are accused of releasing greenhouse gases, especially the methane from the infamous cow burps, using too much water, taking too much land and causing deforestation etc etc. Diana Rogers and Robb Wolf in their book /Sacred Cow/ thoroughly debunk these.

To give just a few pointers, over 90% of the water that cattle need is rainfall. It would have fallen anyway. This is unlike some crops like rice, avocados, walnuts and sugar that require /more/ water per kilo of food produced than beef and most of the water they need is fresh surface and groundwater. They also cause more water pollution than cattle.

Many of the landscapes that are used as pastures are not suitable for growing crops. They might be too hilly, the soil might be too rocky and brittle and the only thing that really grows there is grass. The ruminant animals like cows, sheep, goats and buffalo eating that grass are in no way competing with humans. Rather, they are turning something we can't eat, grown in an area where we can't grow our food, into something that provides valuable nutrition.

While it is true that farm animals are often fed using crops we grow, this is often not the parts of the plants that humans could eat. This is especially true for ruminants, that only get about 10-13% of their diet from grains and the rest comes from crop residues, such as cornstalks, soybean hulls, cottonseed meal, almond husks etc. These are all leftover from the production of human food, alcohol, biofuel etc. There are no cows eating edamame beans, but they are fed the leftovers after the soy plants are processed.

Pigs and chickens are fed a lot more grains, but even those are usually indedible for humans. 

When it comes to the greenhouse gases, the methane released from the cow's digestion is the same that would be released if the grass it ate had been left to rot. This carbon is a part of the cycle. The grass took it from the air, used it to build it's own body, the cow ate it, released some of it back into the air during digestion, incorporated the rest into its own body. The carbon that is in all living things is a part of this cycle. This is now even reflected in the newer, more accurate, methods of calculating the greenhouse warming potential -- and according to this, ruminants only add greenhouse gases to the atmosphere if their numbers increase.

But really, when you think about it, carbon is the molecule of life and we are all exchanging it between each other and the air. Cows are not the only ones adding it to the atmosphere. We all are. Even plants are breathing out carbon dioxide as a result of the cellular respiration. But unlike animals, plants are also taking it in and using in the process of photosynthesis. And so when they are growing, they are taking in more CO2 than releasing, but when they're grow slows down, they become closer to carbon-neutral.

Greenhouse gases are released by termites (a lot, actually), rice fields, wetlands, other herbivores, like horses, reindeer and zebras, as well as by some shellfish. These are all a part of the carbon cycle in nature. How much of nature do we want to get rid of to reduce greenhouse gases? Maybe we should instead focus on things that are not a part of the cycle, like the fossil fuels we dig out of the ground and burn in order to power our society.

There are many issues with how most animals are reared nowadays, but this problem is not inherent to the animal agriculture as such. 

As is the tagline of /Sacred Cow/: It's not the cow, it's the how.

I would take it even further, and say this applies to all of our food production, be it plants or animals. Huge monocultures of grains that require a lot of chemical inputs, decimate the wildlife, and leave the soil depeleted, are not really better for anyone and anything than feedlots are.

For all of agriculture, it's the how. 

*** Totalitarian agriculture of What should I kill today?
In his book /A bold return to giving a damn/, Will Harris describes how he turned his farm from a typical industrial cattle operation, into a thriving regenerative farm that supports several farm animals, creates space for wildlife, regenerates the soil, all without artificial pesticides, fertlisers and antibiotics. There are even studies showing his farm White Oak Pastures is a carbon sink.

Will Harris talks about how, before, he would wake up in the morning, walk out, and look for things he needed to kill. While what he is looking for now, is more life, and ways for him to support it. Working with nature, not against it.

As Daniel Quinn points out in /Ishmael/, killing is a staple in the type of agriculture that our civilisation practices. He calls it a totalitarian agriculture. What we are seeking is total control and maximum return. If there are other beings competing with us for our food, we get rid of them (like wolves and other predators). If there are other beings that compete with our food for their food, we get rid of them (like other grass eating herbivores or insects, or anything). And if there are other beings competing with our foods food, we get rid of them (like weeds).

The holy work of modern farming is killing.

What we aren't (or weren't) paying attention to, is that killing all of these wild, "unnecessary" organisms has consequences that we cannot foresee. The nature favours diversity, and it's how it creates abundance. It works in circles. Everything comes out of, and then returns to the soil. We have been doing our best to destroy the diversity and to turn the circles into straight lines going from the soil into the economy.

Agriculture existed long before the agricultural revolution. Humans have been nudging nature to give them more of what they want for ages. The agricultural revolution was the dawn of the totalitarian agriculture -- the thinking that everything on the Earth is for us to do with as we please. That we take precedens over all the other organisms and are here to conquer and rule.

:END:

I haven't been feeling like myself for the last 5 months. Actually, that is a bit of an understatement. I have been so absolutely, utterly exhausted that it affected everything. I had to slow down considerably in all areas of my life. Work, hobbies, house chores, everything. There was no chance in hell I could attempt something like exercise. Just getting through a normal day would leave me so exhausted I had to sleep for most of the next day. I have been frustrated, scatter-brained, unmotivated and unfocused. Often irritable, often feeling down.

It started in early December last year, when I went through my third round of Covid. While the infection itself was very mild, it jump started whatever is going on with me now. Apart from the ridiculous exhaustion and the other signs of burnout, my immune system got all messed up. Any tiny little infection drags on for weeks, while my autoimmune issues, which have been dormant for the last five years, came back with a vengeance. Thankfully, I am slowly getting better.

I have been trying to "fix" myself from all angles, frustrated at the slow progress, at the two-steps-forward-and-one-step-back dance of recovery. But I have finally accepted where I am and started appreciating how much has improved since last December.

I thought I might share some of the things that helped me with you.

/Btw, none of the links here are affiliate links, nor is anything sponsored. I have just been reading a lot lately./

*** There is no border between the mental and the physical

You might be wondering why I used burnout in the title of this article, but then proceeded to talk about Covid. There are several reasons for this.

Truth is, I was never diagnosed with long Covid. When I first went to a doctor, there were a few things that were off on my blood tests, like inflammation and electrolyte imbalances, but those could be explained by the string of never-ending infections I was having around that time. They also all returned to normal within a month, while my exhaustion, while improved, continued on. My doctor found nothing wrong with me physically. She attributes my symptoms to stress.

The other thing is, this is not my first rodeo. I have been burnt out before. Granted, it has never been this bad, but I have been dipping dangerously close to burnout ever since I was in high school, and falling straight into it at least twice before.
It didn't feel much different, although this time it feels more acute than ever before. Whatever the cause, the symptoms I am experiencing are those of a burnout.

And finally, in my search for answers and ways to restore my health, I found out that all mental illnesses are actually metabolic ones. In his book [[https://brainenergy.com/][/Brain Energy/]], a psychiatrist Dr. Chris Palmer outlines his theory about the origin of mental illnesses. It's an incredible, paradigm-shifting book, written with great compassion and profound insight. Dr. Palmer gathers convincing evidence pointing towards a common pathway behind every single mental syndrome, from anxiety and depression, through ADHD, autism, OCD, eating disorders, substance abuse disorders and bipolar, to schizophrenia, epilepsy and Alzheimer's. All of them, absolutely all, can be explained by a dysfunction in the mitochondria. And so they can all be improved by improving the function of the mitochondria. How do you improve the function of your mitochondria? Since mitochondria are so central to our metabolism and basically all that is happening in our cells, they are affected by almost everything happening both with our bodies and our minds. What we eat, how much we sleep, light exposure, stress, inflammation, loneliness,... you name it.


**** Is it "real"?
I have now spent several months trying to figure out whether the root cause of my issues was physical or mental. Is it really stress? Is it lingering inflammation from the Covid? Am I maybe missing some nutrients? Is it my autism catching up with me? Is it autoimmunity?

I think I wanted to know whether what I was experiencing was "real". Whether I should give myself some slack, or whether I should try to "pull myself up by the bootstraps". I feel a little ashamed typing it, because it is a really dumb way to think about it, and I would never ever apply that kind of thinking to anyone else. Yet somewhere deep down, I felt like "physical=real" and "mental=I just have to work on my mindset". 

After reading /Brain Energy/, I realised the question of whether it is physical or mental does not make sense. Physical stressors can lead to mental symptoms and mental stressors can lead to physical symptoms. After all, we are one body. Our mind resides in our brain and that brain is intimately connected to everything else in our body. How could it be otherwise?

I decided that whatever is happening with me, I might as well call it by what it feels like. And the way to fix it will necessarily involve working on all levels -- physical, mental, emotional. 

So without further ado, here is the top four things that are helping me recover from burnout.

*** 1. Sleep
While most of us know that sleep is important, at the same time it feels so painfully unproductive. It is so easy to stay up "just a little bit more" to do this or that, either for work or for leisure. I know I myself am often guilty of the revenge bedtime procrastination -- staying up later than I actually want to, taking control of my time, because between work and kids I feel like my time during the day isn't quite mine.

I know I am not alone. We have a sleepless epidemic. Yet sleep is so vitally important. This time of rest is especially important for the brain, which is not actually resting that much. There are a lot of processes of clean-up and repair going on, as well as consolidating all the inputs from the day.

Sleep is crucial for memory, focus and even creativity. The [[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7751730/][extra sleep actually makes narcoleptic people more creative!]] But getting too little sleep also makes your blood pressure go up, makes you more hungry and exacerbates all mental and metabolic disorders. Body and mind, sleep affects it all.

In the first weeks of my acute burnout, I was not really left much choice. I was so tired that I couldn't do much else, so  I slept 15 hours a day. But it didn't take more than a few weeks before I started feeling much much better and was able to return to some of my normal activities.

Since then, I am finding sleep to be the number one factor that decides how I experience my day. Now, by most people's standards, I was never sleeping that little. Even before all this, I would average 7 or 7.5 hours a night. It's hard to know whether it was enough back then, but I can clearly see it is not enough now. There are a number of things that will increase our need for sleep, like inflammation or stress. So while I don't like "losing" even more hours to sleep than before, I know that it will make the waking ones much better.

And I remind myself of the wisdom that was hanging on the wall of my classroom in high school: "Sleeping is living too."

#+attr_html: :alt A cute drawing of a child and his plushies sleeping. Text in French says "Dormir, c'est vivre aussi...", meaning "Sleeping is living too...".
#+caption: I actually found the poster we had hanging in my high school classroom. It seems like it came straight from France from some 90s campaign for better sleep. I remember how its message: "Sleeping is living too" felt meaningful in those days when we were staying up late with homework. 
[[file:burnout_dormir-c-est-vivre-aussi.jpg]]


*** 2. Diet
Nutrition has everything to do with everything and is probably the number one thing to fix when dealing with, well, anything.

There is now a whole new field -- nutritional psychiatry -- that focuses on dietary solutions to mental illnesses. Dr. Georgia Ede is a psychiatrist specialising in nutritional psychiatry and her book /Change Your Diet, Change Your Mind/ [[https://www.amazon.com/Change-Your-Diet-Mind-Powerful/dp/1538739070][(link to Amazon]]) is one of the best books I read not only on nutrition for mental health, but on nutrition as such.

She uses the physiology of the brain as a starting point to figure out what the brain needs in terms of food and how to keep it happy. Thankfully (and logically), the brain requires the same kind of nutrition to thrive as the rest of the body. The book is engaging, accessible and actionable. It offers different dietary approaches that one can tailor to their needs. I really enjoyed it.

Some of the biggest take-aways are the need to be careful with carbohydrates and plant toxins. Humans are quite prone to becoming insulin-resistant when exposed to larger amounts of carbohydrates over time. In fact, [[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/11/181128115045.htm][in the US, 88% of people are already insulin-resistant]]. Insulin resistance means that the various organs in the body stop responding to insulin. While one of the biggest roles of insulin is to trigger cells to take up glucose from the blood, it does much more than that and so insulin resistance can lead not only to type 2 diabetes, but also to [[https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/01.CIR.98.5.398][cardiovascular disease]], [[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3277302][polycystic ovarian syndrome]] and more.

What does insulin resistance do in the brain? It actually prevents glucose from getting to the brain cells at all, as it gets stopped by the insulin resistant blood-vessel cells at the blood-brain barrier. It means the brain isn't getting the fuel it needs and is basically starving. It's not surprising this can give a range of symptoms, and in worst case [[https://journalofmetabolichealth.org/index.php/jmh/article/view/15][lead to Alzheimer's disease]].

While I personally was already good on the carbohydrate part, I had some room for improvement in the other big area, namely avoiding toxins and compounds I might be sensitive to. After the Covid infection, I started reacting to egg whites, something I didn't want to admit to myself for a while. While the reaction seemed small on the outside (a tiny rash), it's clear it was triggering my immune system and causing trouble on the inside. Inflammation, whether due to an infection, allergy, autoimmunity or injury, is metabolically expensive and demands a lot of resources. It is very likely that it was contributing to my lack of energy and burnout. 

*** 3. Clarity of mind
You know that feeling of having too many tabs open in your head? It's one that I have been periodically experiencing for years. It feels like no matter what I am trying to focus on at the moment, there is large, but unknown number of other thoughts in the background that are trying to come to the forefront. Some of them are clear, some of them only guessed at. And it is utterly overwhelming.

It's also fair to say that being tired and burnout did not make this any better.

I wasn't sure at first what it was that I was missing, until I read [[https://gettingthingsdone.com/][/Getting Things Done/]] by David Allen. I have heard about GTD (as people call it) before, but wasn't quite interested in getting more things done. But that is actually not what the method is about. It is about exactly the thing I was seeking -- /clarity of mind/.

GTD is a method to gather, process and organise all your open loops. Open loops are all of those thoughts hiding in the tabs in the back of your mind. Using the GTD method, you get them out, onto a paper or into an app, so your head can let go of them. And while I haven't been using it for more than a month yet, it works. It is simple, easy to get started and ingenious. The output of the method is just a bunch of lists that you can keep track of in whatever way you want. I won't go into details about how to use the method, since there are a lot of resources online, not to mention the book itself.

But I will say that if you constantly feel like you are forgetting something important, like you should probably be doing something else than what you are doing, but you don't know what, if you feel like you have too many tabs open in your mind, then this helps with exactly that.

I have been very much enjoying implementing GTD in my life. I am finding myself experiencing mental clarity much more often, as is the expected outcome. But I have also gained a better overview of my days and my life. By catching every thought that feels like it might be important yet unfinished, I have been able to realise how many new interesting things and ideas I ran into on a daily basis. I am no longer surprised by my previous feelings of a crowded head-space. And what is more, this overview really helps me prioritise. Prioritising is not something I am naturally good at, and being clear about my vision, goals and principles rarely helped me with that in the nitty-gritty of the daily life. But having the GTD lists in front of me does.

Thinking about it, I might have even gotten a little more productive, especially given my limited energy these days. And I have even tackled some tasks that I have been putting off for more than a year. (For real. I was planning to get frames for some of our pictures and hang them up, but I just kept rewriting the task from one to-do list to the next for over a year. Until GTD.)

The other practice I find immensely useful for mental clarity is journaling and especially morning pages. The morning pages were popularised by Julia Cameron in her book /The Artist's Way/ (which I haven't read). Morning pages simply mean writing down 3 pages by hand, first thing in the morning, of whatever comes to mind. It's pure stream of consciousness. I find it to be incredibly useful to find any "tabs" that have been left open in my mind, to figure out what I think and feel about different things and what is lurking in the back of my mind. I often write little note in the margins of my morning-pages book that I then transfer into a GTD inbox. 

*** 4. Taking off pressure
I have to admit that this forced slowing down was not something that I adjusted to easily or happily. I didn't think I was doing particularly much before, so I was not keen on doing less. Plus, as I said earlier, I half-thought I just needed to pull it together.

I was terribly tired and refusing to act like it, and so, unsurprisingly, I was not performing my best in my job, all the while pushing myself as hard as I could. As a result, I felt guilty and mad at myself. I started feeling like I was bad at what I was doing. My impostor syndrome was blooming. I lost all interest in my work. I felt unfocused and unmotivated. I considered changing jobs many times in the last months, but I couldn't really see how I could find anything better. I felt trapped.

Finally, I admitted to myself that I am not in top form and that that will quite naturally affect how much I can do at work and how I will feel about it. And so I stopped pushing so hard.

I decided to stop forcing myself to do work that I felt completely uninspired to do. 

Now, I am very lucky in that I can afford to do this at my job. The projects I am working on are very long-term ones and I have a lot of freedom in how and when I work. This will definitely not work for many others. 

I know though that waiting for when I will "feel like it" is not a viable option either. Feeling the way I did, I would probably never "feel like it".

So I started doing two things: working on my motivation for my work, and using a visit-based work system.

**** Sharpening the axe of motivation
This is an idea I heard from Elizabeth Filips ([[https://www.youtube.com/@elizabethfilips][link to Elizabeth Filips' YouTube]]). When you lack motivation, tasks, especially ones that require creativity, learning and synthesising knowledge, will take much longer than they would otherwise, and the result will likely be much worse.

You wouldn't see time spent sharpening your axe as wasted, just because your main goal is to chop down a tree. It makes just as much sense to spend some time building up motivation for a task, when we know it will make it much easier and faster to get it done.

And so I started doing that. I brainstorm all the things I like about my job, all the skills related to it that I would like to learn, all the side projects I would like to try. When I really don't feel like working on my main task, rather than feeling guilty and forcing myself to stare at it, uninspired, I work on something else.

All this might sound quite obvious to some, and it won't be applicable for others at all. For me it was a game-changer that restored my enthusiasm for my work.

**** Visit-based instead of force-based planning
While I was going down the GTD rabbit hole, I ran into the work of [[https://kouroshdini.com][Kourosh Dini]]. As a pianist, he is very familiar with tasks that require regularity and motivation at the same time. One of the main things I adopted from his approach to organising work is the idea of a Visit.

Most of us are used to leaving orders for our future selves. Inevitably, there are times when the future isn't the way we imagined it and our future self has to skip or modify the job we left for her, often leading to feelings of guilt and failure. This is the force-based system.

One the other hand, you have the Visit-based planning. A Visit means sitting down with your work and considering it. Kourosh Dini says to remain with it at least for the length of a single breath. It gives you the space to consider the task, to start it, if that feels right, and to do as much of it as is right under the circumstances.

The only thing you plan for your future self is to visit the work and you trust her to make the right decision in that moment.
It is about creating space, rather than obligations.

Obviously, this is not something that is suitable for all types of tasks, but I found it invaluable for those that if fits. I use it a lot for my creative writing at home and for big coding projects at work. I plan a daily recurring Visit, which more often than not turns into a nice flow-filled work session. But if it doesn't, that is OK too. 

*** Getting better takes time
These last five months have been a journey. The road here was bumpy and winding and frustrating, and I know I am not quite were I would like to be yet. But looking back, I can see how much better I have gotten, and I am very grateful for that. 

The strategies I outlined here are just some of the things I have tried. I have also been practising more meditation and hypnosis ([[https://noriparelius.com/post/brain-hacking/][I had great results from hypnosis previously]]), doing breathing exercises and lately started experimenting with fasting. Sometimes it's hard to know what works (or how well), but I chose to talk about what I think made the biggest difference. It obviously won't be applicable and helpful for everyone, so take what makes sense to you and leave the rest. I wish you all the best.
