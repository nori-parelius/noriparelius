If we shrank the lifetime of our species into one hour, we would still have been hunters and gatherers two minutes ago.

We have the bodies and the minds of our ancient ancestors, while living in this exciting, wonderful, confusing, modern, human zoo. 

I can't be the only one who finds it a bit tricky sometimes, I think.

This personal blog is about the things I think about, learn about, try and test, in my attempts to get better at being human.

I am and always have been a scientist at heart. And a nerd with a touch of the ’tism.


I like to dive into various topics, dig in the research, test things and learn. And rant. Oh, ranting is probably my favourite hobby. And I lowkey want to save the world.

I have a PhD in biophysics, although my current day job is in data analysis. I’m also a movement enthusiast and a corrective exercise specialist.

I am an expat from Slovakia living in Norway with my Viking husband and two little wildlings.

*** Can I drop my body off at the gym and pick it up when it's done?


As a teenager I used to always listen to music or audiobooks when I went for a run. I did it because running and exercise were a chore - a boring, annoying, but necessary chore. I didn't do it for the fun of it. I just wanted to lose weight and get into shape (mostly so that I would be able to run away from the aliens if I found myself in an episode of Doctor Who). I loved the feeling I got after running, but definitely not during. 

It's common to see exercise as a chore that we just want to get over with, but today I will tell you about all the reasons why a focused movement practice is good for not only your body, but also your brain. 

*** I move, therefore I am

When we talk about movement, we often think of musculoskeletal system - the muscles and the bones. We tend to forget that there is one more very important system involved: the nervous system. 

If I want to drink my tea, I just reach my hand, pick up the cup, bring it to my mouth and drink. No real thinking required. But even such a seemingly simple movement requires an incredibly well coordinated effort from a large number of muscles. Everything needs to be just right. Just the right strength of a contraction at just the right time. And that's what the brain is there for.

#+begin_quote
Movement might actually be the reason why we have a brain at all! 
#+end_quote


According to one theory, animals evolved a brain in order to be able to freely move through their environment. The complex interactions with one's surroundings simply required a brain. Plants manage without one, but they usually don't get very far. Even for us humans, a species that likes to use our brains for a bunch of stuff, movement still takes up a massive part of its capacity. 

*** Your brain prefers dancing over sudoku

I have nothing against sudoku, but if you would like to train your brain then movement can get you better results. There are [[https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa022252][studies that look specifically at the effect of dancing on the cognitive abilities and dementia risk in elderly people]]. The effects are overwhelmingly positive and the best out of the tested activities, followed by crossword puzzles and reading. Biking, swimming and golf however didn't make much of a difference. 

#+begin_quote
What is it about dancing that was so beneficial for the brain? The most likely answer is that it was the need to learn new things and to constantly react and adjust to the music and the dancing partner. 
#+end_quote

In dancing there is a tight feedback loop involved in dancing. The brain needs to carefully monitor the inputs - music, partner, space, own body, and decide how to react to it. There are many possibilities and often new moves. The environment is complex and our movement through it is complex. It is what the brain is so good at and also what is good for it. 

I would guess that dancing isn't the only type of movment that could provide this benefit, although I can't back it up by any studies, as most focus on ballroom dancing. But we can experience similar movement complexity and interactions with our environment in other situations too. A hike through a challengening terrain, balancing, climbing a tree. Maybe even an artificial obstacle course. 

*** We are what we focus on the most

As  the saying goes: practice makes perfect.  But only under one important condition. The practice has to be focused.  
Our brain is able to perform familiar movements on autopilot.  It simply starts the stored program and executes the pattern.  It’s  fast and efficient.  But what if the pattern blueprint isn’t correct?  Well in that case we will be practicing and training the incorrect movement over and over again. 

To improve,  we need to establish a feedback loop. The brain needs to be  continuously adjusting the movement  in reaction  to the feedback it receives.  That requires focus. 

We can hack this focus with certain types of movements,  the kind that just won’t work if we’re not responsive enough.  And  that brings us back to the ballroom dancing.  But also balancing.  If you do it wrong,  you fall.  Hiking  in  terrain that isn’t flat and level  requires a  similar amount of focus and  continuous response to the environment.  Jumping rope  also provides an immediate feedback forcing you to do it well or not at all.

With many other movements it’s up to us to bring in the focus and awareness.

The good news is,  that the focus is our key to improving the quality of our movements.  If  a  movement pattern stored in our brain isn’t good enough,  all we need is focused practice to imprint a  new pattern.  And  although it does take time,  the more we practice, the faster it happens.

*** Play, practice, train

One of the foundations of good and safe movement is self-awareness.  We all have our limitations, but being aware of them is what allows us to use our full abilities and  reduce the risk of injuries. 


#+begin_quote
How to build good movement? Play, practice, train. In that order. With self-awareness.
#+end_quote

The ultimate way to develop self-awareness is play. Play is an exploration. An exploration of one's own abilities, of the environment and how they can play together. In play, we test our boundaries, we feel what feels right and we experiment with various ways of doing the same. It allows us to know ourselves and to find what works. 

Only then can we move onto practice. Practice is deliberate and focused. Now that we have explored the possibilities through play, we know better where we want to get. We can then start practicing the movements. Focusing on the feedback from our bodies and our environment and using it to refine the movement. 

Training is the las step that only makes sense after we have been through play and practice stages. Now that we have a correct movement pattern blueprint in the brain, we can start adding intensity to it, whether through higher loads, speeds or number of repetitions. 

For most people who aren't athletes, the play and practice stages are the most important. They train the brain the most, they help us develop self-awareness, correct movement patterns and despite what it might soud like, they do also train and strenghten the muscles. Plus, it's where most of the fun is.

#+begin_quote
Nobody would dream of leaving their brain behind when going to practice playing a  music instrument.  Practicing movement isn’t really that different.

*** Disconnected and dysfunctional

I used to be a nerdy little bookworm as a kid and as a teenager. And honestly a bit of a couch potato. If I could sit in a comfy armchair with a book, I would sit in a comfy armchair with a book.

I also used to be a "good girl". Doing what I was expected to do and following the rules both spoken and implied. So I would sit "properly", never run around in the corridors and favour academic achievements over physical prowess.

It was subconcious - I never really decided not to move - but it was happening and it had consequences.

I was just 12 when a doctor told me that my knee pain was due to worn cartilages and there was nothing to do about it. By the time I entered my twenties I not only had bad knees, but also a wonky ankle, flat feet and regular lower back pain.

And I don't think I even understood how much it affected me mentally...

I wasn't happy with the way I looked and I ingored as best as I could the way I felt in my own body.

#+caption: Year 2013. I'm 24. Sloping shoulders, swayback posture with my pelvis way forward and duck feet. Of course I hurt. 
[[file:move_more_better_Nori_2013_576x1024.png]]

*** It changed, thankfully

It happened in 2015. The beginning of the change, I mean. It was a cold Norwegian January and I was an ever-so-nerdy bookish PhD student. That day I went to a proper gym - probably for the first time in my life. I was suffering from a new-years-resolutionitis and had a vague feeling I should "start exercising (somehow)". I was looking for something that would require as little energy and time as possible.

Well that trip to the gym never repeated itself. But boy oh boy, was it an eye-opener. I was weak, clumsy, awkward and stiff. I had no idea how to move.

Thankfully, I had enough self-awareness left to realize I had no control and was on my way to an injury.

Coming home that day, I started searching the internet. Trying to answer questions like why can't I squat? And this was the real beginning. The nerd's way.

I was studying biophysics and suddenly realized that the mechanics of the human body was actually right up my alley!

I loved reading about it. And I still do!

And before I knew it, I was applying what I was reading to myself and eventually advising others. Also reading more, taking courses, and learning more.

Movement became my passion.

*** Reconnecting with myself

I don't go to the gym. I don't really play sports. I have a full time job and two kids and I don't enjoy gyms and sports enough to make time for them.

Instead I just move.

I make space for movement in my daily life and in my mind, because I know now that it is essential.

My movement practice keeps me
pain free, confident,
moving with ease,
able to enjoy physical activity and
connected to my body and the world around me.

I finally feel at home in my body. I finally feel like I belong. And it's a good feeling.

:END:

I don’t eat a “varied and balanced diet” anymore. I don’t do five a day. There is no rainbow on my plate. And no holy (whole)  grains.  Zero fibre,  actually. On the other hand, I eat lots of saturated fat, cholesterol and salt. 

I eat meat, eggs, fish, salt and water. And that's pretty much it 99% of the time. 

And believe it or not I have never felt better.  

How did I get here? Let us start from the middle...

*** No matter how hard I tried, everything was wrong

My first daugther was a bit over a year old and I was having probably the most difficult time of my life. 

Most people would consider our diet at that time very healthy. It was full of fruits and vegetables, whole grains, heart-healthy plant fats and only relatively small amounts of meat. Everything was prepared at home from fresh ingredients. 

**** Child with alergies

We didn't really have much choice. From the moment the kiddo was born, it was quite clear that she inherited her mother's disposition for allergies. We quickly identified milk and eggs as the main culprit and I dropped them from my diet like a hot potato, because I didn't want to stop breastfeeding her. 

But that wasn't enough. She kept reacting to random things I ate. And when she started solids also to the things she ate. It was a nightmare trying to identify the culprits and medical testing provided only some answers, and clearly not all. So I kept eliminating more and more foods from my diet. 

She was actually doing very well for a child with allergies - most likely thanks to the breastmilk - but I on the other hand... not so much. 

**** I started falling apart
#+caption: That is oatmeal in my bowl. January 2018, 8 months post partum. Tired.
[[file:carnivore_Nori2018_411x637.jpg]]


It slowly crept up on me, but by the time she was a year, I was hardly recognising myself. I was skinny, weak, perpetually tired and always sick.  Any virus passing by would get me and keep me miserable for many weeks. I even managed to break two of my ribs in a coughing fit.  Really.  

My hands were covered in eczema I couldn’t get rid of for ages. My digestion was miserable. I was having so much bloating and unexpected trips to the bathroom that it was often difficult to leave the house.  But the worst of it was the mental part. I was anxious and angry and scared. Sometimes I didn't even know why. I was just not coping at all.

According to my doctor, everything looked fine. 

*** Just meat? Are you out of your gourd?

It continued for way too long without much improvement. Until one day in May 2019, when I was 30 years old and the little one has just turned two. 

And here I have to give credit to my husband who showed me a [[https://imgur.com/gallery/mkzQ6Kk][picture of married couple]] he found online and asked me how old I though they were. I guessed maybe late thirties, at most early fourties. I was super wrong. She was 46 and he was 61. 

And they attributed their youthfull looks and good health to only having eaten beef for the last 20 years. 

**** Carnivore

The people in the picture were [[https://www.allthingscarnivore.com/joe-and-charlene-andersons-carnivore-diet-experience/][Joe and Charlene Andersen]] and as we quickly found out, they are far from the only ones following some version of the so-called carnivore diet, and reporting incredible health benefits. 

#+begin_quote
Carnivore... as in no plant foods at all. I was flabbergasted. It can't be!
#+end_quote


I mean, everyone knows, that vegetables are nutrition, right? You can't live without vegetables!

#+begin_quote
Or?
#+end_quote


Turns out you can. And more than that. You can thrive. We discovered a big community of carnivores online, quite a few of them doctors, researchers and dieticians. And so many stories from all sorts of people. They often sounded like miracles. People who went into remission from their "uncurable" chronic diseases, from eczemas, depression, anxiety, through Crohn's, type 2 diabetes, psoriasis, juvenile arthritis, to epilepsy, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and tooth cavities...

Some even had their grey hair grow dark again. 

#+begin_quote
I usually follow the rule that if something sound too good to be true, then it probably isn't true. 
#+end_quote

*** But there wasn't much to lose this time. 

Of course I didn't go in blindly. I read and I read and I double-checked and carefully considered arguments from all the sides. I was a PhD student at the time and let me tell you, a PhD is mostly a degree in reading scientific literature. So that is what I did here too. And things did check out and did make sense. The last thing left was to try. 

My personal little miracle 

We were going to try it for a month. It has now been over 3 years. It really felt like experiencing my own little miracle. 

#+caption: 7 months carnivore and things are good. Definitely less dark circles under the eyes.
[[file:carnivore_Nori2019_341x767.jpg]]

#+begin_quote
I do indeed thrive.
#+end_quote


- *Digestion* - better than ever. And it used to be really bad. Now I don't think about 99% of the time. Have you ever experienced zero bloat? It's glorious.

- *Skin* - better than ever. Eczema was gone within a week and acne a few weaks later. Plus I don't burn in the sun anymore. Go figure. 

- *Pollen allergies* - basically gone. As long as I am perfectly plant free (including spices) I don't experience any symptoms. And I used to have terrible allergies fo 9 months out of a year!

- *Mental health* - much better. I didn't realize I used to have anxiety until it was gone. The impending sense of doom now only returns when I eat some sugar. 

- *Resistance to getting sick* - definitely better. I still get sick, seeing that I live with two small people that will gladly sneeze in your eyeball and that visit a breeding gourn for pathogens daily (a.k.a. kindergarten). But the illnesses are milder and pass much faster. 


Over the last three years I have been experimenting with adding other foods to my diet and every time I end up going back to a pure carnivore of meat, fish, eggs, salt and water. Because many of the benefits I mentioned here disappear for me, once I add some plant foods. Some people don't feel a difference from adding some coffee or avocado or spices or other plants, but I really do. 

And for as long as this will make me feel the best, I will continue. 

#+begin_quote
The carnivore diet and how and why it works has remained a source of fascination for me. I have never before experienced such a profound change. I wouldn't hesitate to say that carnivore saved my life. And it all makes sense. 

And that's why I just can't keep it to myself.

I really really tried to start an online business, but it was just an endless struggle. I just couldn't get myself to do the things and I couldn't get it right. And so I finally stopped. It was a relief and a disappointment at the same time. And it actually took me close to a year to figure out what went "wrong", and why it's for the best. 

If you are looking for a guide on how to start making money online, this is not it. This is me tracing back my steps, trying to figure out where and why I "failed". And the short story is: It didn't agree with me. The long story is… well, longer:

*** A course that was supposed to save me

It was at a time in my life when I was seriously struggling with balancing work and family. I had a small child that needed my presence more than the average toddler, but I just had to go back to work, there was no other choice. So I was drowning in guilt, fatigue and tears (both mine and hers).

#+begin_quote
I wanted a way out.
#+end_quote


And that way out seemed to appear on Instagram, out of all places. Some of the people I was following mentioned having gone through a life-changing course about starting an online business. So I followed the account of the lovely lady who runs it. And at first I didn't think it was the right thing for me, but with each passing post and each passing month, I was getting more and more convinced to give it a try.

I followed for about a year before I signed up. I already had a blog from before (which was just for fun), and I felt I had things to say. So why not?

#+begin_quote
I gave it my all.
#+end_quote

I was posting on my blog, on Facebook, on Instagram, sending a newsletter, I had several "free" ebooks that I exchanged for people's email addresses and at the end of the course, I had my paid ebook. I was proud of it. It was good.

#+begin_quote
And then I hit a wall.*
#+end_quote

I couldn't get myself to promote my ebook. I couldn't get myself to mention it on social media. I kept lowering the price of my ebook every few weeks. I lost steam completely. I tried to pick up where I left again and again, thinking it was writer's block or imposter syndrome or whatever, but I just couldn't get myself to write and post with any regularity again. There were months between each addition and writing was a pain.

Eventually, I stopped. I felt like a failure. I had all the tools necessary to get this to work, and I have seen other people who made it. But not me. I simply wasn't good enough.

At least that is how I felt for a very long time.

*** Making people want

I learned a lot from the course.

Did you know that most people buy only after five or more contacts with the seller? And that marketers are deliberately appealing to our feelings and telling us how their product will make us feel and how it will change our lives? That they know we are more likely to buy under time pressure, so they come up with time-limited offers, real or fake?

It's nothing new, really. Nothing ground-breaking. It's like those fabric softener ads on TV that show people running through fields of flowers, rather than telling you that it will make your towels soft and smell like some chemical approximation of flowers. A bit ridiculous, right?

I kind of knew or suspected many of it before, but reading it black on white was a little jarring. Still, I tried to do it too, but I was really bad at it. I just couldn't do it properly. It was a topic in the course too, actually: "I am bad at selling". We were told we deserved to be paid for our efforts and for all the value we were providing for people. After all, the money would allow us to make more content. It was a reciprocal relationship. And all of that makes perfect sense, of course. But I was still failing miserably.

**** It's magic

It's only recently that I started looking at it from the other side though. From the side of a customer. We all know marketing and ads are fake and manipulative, yet we all think we are immune to them. I admit I did. I thought I wouldn't let something like that influence my choices. 

Then I read about Tristan Harris - a technology ethicist, vocal critic of social media and founder of the [[https://www.humanetech.com/][Center for Humane Technology]]. He compared social media to magicians. We all know magicians are using tricks and we are often trying to look for it, yet almost all of us get fooled over and over again. It has nothing to do with intelligence. They are simply using our inherent human "weaknesses", the way our brain works, to trick us. But while magicians do it for our delight, social media and ads do it for other reasons. Why would companies use as much money as they do for advertising, if it didn't work?

#+begin_quote
Manipulation doesn't stop working just because we know we are being manipulated.
#+end_quote

**** Social media work for marketers

Tristan Harris is featured in the Netflix documentary The Social Dilemma and also in Johann Hari's book Stolen Focus. I enjoyed Stolen Focus tremendously, and while it covers a lot more ground than just social media, they are one of the main topics. At the time when I was reading the book I was feeling overwhelmed and like I had too many tabs open in my brain. Stolen Focus inspired me to quit social media and it actually helped.

Ever wondered how social media make money? We, the end users, are certainly not paying them. Their business model relies on money from ads. The marketers are their real customers, while our eyeballs are the product. In order to make advertisers happy, social media need to keep us scrolling for as long as possible (to see the most ads), and preferably to buy as well. They don't care whether we feel good being there, or angry and upset, as long as we are there. 

In my online business course, I learned a lot about how Facebook was this wonderful money machine. How easy it was to target the right people, how it would learn who to show the ads to and how for every cent you throw in for ads, you get two back. (Given you manage to write a good ad, which I never could, but that's not the point.)

Social media are full of people trying to sell. We are interacting with ads without even knowing they are ads. They might not be selling anything in that post, just getting us ready to buy in a day or a week. It's sneaky. And it works.

*** Selling dreams

#+begin_quote
I started wondering how much I was influenced by these subtle and less subtle ads.
#+end_quote

What about the course I was so sad about not being able to buy, since it cost 2000 euros? If my brain wasn't massaged for more than a year, would I have even wanted it? What course is even worth 2000 euros? Would my life have been easier if I have never heard about it? Would it be so life-changinly (I know it's not a word) worth it, if I had bought it? I don't have answers. Just questions.

Would I have bought that online business course, expensive as it was, if I weren't looking at all the posts about traveling, exotic places, spending time with family, all while making money? The word freedom popping up over and over again? Did I want to learn and do online marketing? Or did I want the freedom? Because freedom can't really be sold. The real product was a course about online marketing. What made me want to buy it was the vision of freedom. I wanted the result, not the journey.

Now, I don't want to throw any shade on that particular course and its author. It's a good course that worked for a good number of people and she never recommends anything outright unethical. I think she has more integrity than most marketers. She is also honest about the course not being a magic bullet and about success requiring a lot of hard work, time and dedication. She never lies about things.

And yet. And yet I wonder how many of us get seduced by the regular images of far-away places and vague promise of freedom. 

#+begin_quote
Seduced by posts written by a skilled marketer, delivered to us several times a day by powerful algorithms behind social media.
#+end_quote


I'm not saying it's unethical. I'm just realizing how susceptible I am to the marketing magic. And I'm realizing it's not something I would be ok with doing, personally. I don't want to make people want things, I don't want to create desires that might not have been there, just to sell my stuff. Whether I deserve the reward or not. I think there is already too much wanting in this world.

*** Gift economy

I realize I am talking from a place of privilege. I have a stable, full-time job that I love and that provides enough money for a fairly comfortable life. Nothing extra, no exotic places, but safety and security. I have good affordable childcare and two little kids that enjoy spending their time there. I don't really need a side hustle. I have the choice. I am well aware that not everyone does.

Sometimes I wish though that the world would be a bit different. A bit kinder and gentler, less eager to make quick and easy money. I read an absolutely wonderful book - Braiding Sweetgrass by Robin Wall Kimmerer. It's very difficult to say what that book is about. Robin is a botanist and a Native American and in Braiding Sweetgrass she talks a lot about plants, about nature and about our relationship with them from the point of view of indigenous peoples. It's an incredibly beautiful book full of wisdom and love.

I never thought I would be reminded of Braiding Sweetgrass while thinking of online marketing, but here we are. One of the ideas Robin introduces is gift economy. 

#+begin_quote
Gift economy. A world where every living thing freely shares their gifts with the others, and in return receives gifts with gratitude and respect for the giver. A world of reciprocity. A world where one doesn't just ask: "what can I get?", but mostly: "what can I give?". A world where gifts are appreciated and treasured.
#+end_quote

The plentiful bounty of Americas at the time when European colonizers arrived wasn't an accident. It was the result of careful stewardship of the land by the native peoples. It was gift economy between humans and nature in practice. It was the result of honorable harvest - never taking more than is given, never taking more than a half, giving back in return,…

Can you imagine a harvest where you only harvest half?! Crazy. And beautiful.

Now I know the world is headed in the opposite way nowadays, but that doesn't mean I have to follow. And so I am quite content with my short-lived venture into the competitive world of online business being over. It wasn't for me.

#+begin_verse
And since I have the luxury of "failing" at selling, I can do this instead. Go back to having a blog, just for fun. Freely sharing my gifts with anyone who might benefit, doing my part in the gift economy.
