If we shrank the lifetime of our species into one hour, we would still have been hunters and gatherers two minutes ago.

We have the bodies and the minds of our ancient ancestors, while living in this exciting, wonderful, confusing, modern, human zoo. 

I can't be the only one who finds it a bit tricky sometimes, I think.

This personal blog is about the things I think about, learn about, try and test, in my attempts to get better at being human.

My knee problems started when I was about 12. I would feel sharp pain deep in my joints when I was skiing, running and at times when it was worst, even walking.

The doctors told me to just say good bye to skiing, because there was nothing to do. Probably worn cartilages, that was the verdict. At 12 years old! I was not the most active child, so that didn't quite compute, but I was chubby by the 90s and early 2000s standards, which was quite enough a reason.

I was pretty stricken, as any 12 year old facing their mortality like that probably would be. Pretty melodramatic too. I thought that was it, that it would only go downhill from there. But, a decde and half later the things started going very much uphill and I actually fixed my knee problems! 
Moje problémy s kolenami začali, keď som mala asi 12 rokov. Cítila som v nich ostrú, bodavú bolesť pri lyžovaní, behaní, a v obdobiach, keď to bolo najhoršie, dokonca aj pri chôdzi.

Lekár mi vtedy povedal, že mám opotrebované chrupavky, že s tým už nič, a že teda nemám lyžovať. Opotrebované chrupavky. V dvanástich rokoch! Ak by som sa venovala vrcholovým športom, možno, ale ja som bola úplne normálne, skôr pokojné dieťa, bez akýchkoľvek športových ambícií.

Pamätám si, ako ma to vtedy zasiahlo. Prvýkrát v živote mi bolo niečo, čo sa nedalo opraviť. Zaplavil ma pocit smrteľnosti. (Človek vie byť dosť melodramatický v dvanástich.) V každom prípade, som si myslela, že už to so mnou pôjde iba dole vodou. Na moje šťastie to o 15 rokov začalo ísť hore vodou, a ja som svoje problémy s kolenami vyliečila. A preto tento článok bude o chodidlách.

Chodidlá – základ človeka

Čo majú chodidlá spoločné s kolenami? Veľmi veľa. Tak ako majú veľmi veľa spoločné s bedrovými kĺbami, zadkom, chrbtom aj krkom. Chodidlá nesú celú našu váhu. Pri chôdzi a behu dokonca sila, ktorou dopadáme na zem zodpovedá niekoľkonásobku našej váhy. Až keď som pozorovala svoju malú dcéru, ako sa učí chodiť, uvedomila som si, aké je neuveriteľné, že dokážeme bez námahy balansovať celé naše dlhé telá na takej malej ploche.

Nohy sú ako základy domu. Ak sú krivé, a nakláňa sa nám kvôli nim strecha, je zbytočné opravovať strechu. Aj keď chodidlá nie sú možno najcoolovejšia téma, je to základ, a preto z tohto asi urobím sériu. A začneme s tým, prečo by sme nemali chodiť s nohami smerujúcimi do strán.
Prečo by chodidlá mali smerovať dopredu

Poobzerajte sa okolo seba (a nezabudnite sa poobzerať aj pod seba, na svoje nohy) a určite si všimnete, že veľa ľudí chodí s nohami (alebo len jednou) trochu (alebo veľmi) vytočenými do strán. Prsty im nesmerujú dopredu, ale šikmo do strán. Zopár stupňov, 5-10, nie je ešte problém, ale viac než to môže mať ďalekosiahle následky. Tak si to rozoberme postupne po častiach tela, od dola hore.
Chodidlá a členky
Plochá noha

Státím s nohami do strán nám spadne klenba. Povedal vám lekár, že máte ploché nohy? Môže to byť “skutočná” plochá noha, často následkom zranenia, alebo to môže byť spôsobené len tým, ako ju používate.

Naša klenba nie je vytesaná z kameňa tak ako tá na kostole. Je skôr ako pružina zo svalov a šliach. Keď chodíme s nohami smerujúcimi von, klenba spadne a prestane pružiť. Za normálnych okolností noha dokáže absorbovať energiu z dopadu chodidla na zem práve vďaka klenbe, ale pri plochej nohe sa tieto nárazy prenášajú vyššie, ku kolenám, bedrovým kĺbom a chrbtu. A ani topánky s hrubou podrážkou, bublinami, alebo pružinami to celkom nevyriešia.

Okrem toho, plochá noha namáha šľachy, ktoré by mali v spolupráci so svalmi klenbu držať. Na ich smolu totiž v tomto prípade svaly pracujú proti nim. Na spodku nohy sa nachádza plochá šľacha, ktorá sa volá plantárna aponeuróza, a ktorá spája prsty s pätou. Je natiahnutá medzi nimi ako taká gumička a pomáha zachovať klenbu. Pri plochých nohách je táto šľacha natiahnutá. Ak ju naťahujeme príliš, môže začať bolieť.

Nestabilný členok

Ďalšia skupina šliach pomáha stabilizovať a spevniť členok. Keď je chodidlo otočené smerom von v porovnaní s predkolením, šľachy na vonkajšej strane členka sú v uvoľnenej polohe. Je to preto, že kosti, ktoré spájajú, sú príliš blízko pri sebe a šľachy sa na rozdiel od svalov nevedia stiahnuť. Členok stráca stabilitu a je ľahšie si ho vyvrtnúť.
Vbočené palce

Vbočené palce, alebo takzvané haluxy, vedia byť celkom problém, a možno o nich niekedy napíšem celý článok. Veľmi často sú dôsledkom nosenia tesných topánok, ktoré stláčajú prsty k sebe, až tie prsty tak ostanú. Sú však aj ľudia, ktorí nosia viac-menej pohodlné topánky, a aj tak skončia s vybočenými palcami. Úzke topánky totiž nie sú jediným možným dôvodom ich vzniku.

Pri chôdzi by sa váha mala presúvať od päty k prstom pozdĺž osi chodidla. To znamená, že počas kroku sa chodidlo ohne pod prstami a tým veľkým kĺbom na báze palca a palcom samotným sa môžeme odtlačiť od zeme. Ale teraz si predstavte, že chodidlá smerujú do strany, lenže my chceme ísť samozrejme dopredu. Miesto toho, aby sme váhu preniesli pozdĺž palca, prevalíme ju cez jeho stranu a zatláčame ho každým krokom k ostatným prstom. A tadá, vbočené palce aj bez úzkych topánok.

Kolená

Posuňme sa teraz trochu vyššie, ku kolenám. Noha, ktorá je vytočená do strany, väčšinou vedie k určitej rotácii aj v úrovni kolena. Kolenné väzy sú potom príliš natiahnuté, alebo práve uvoľnené, podľa toho, či sú ich konce zrazu neobvykle ďaleko, alebo blízko pri sebe. Na rozdiel od svalov, väzy a šľachy sa nevedia sťahovať, a na ich optimálnu funkciu je naozaj dôležité, aby vzájomná poloha kostí, ktoré spájajú, bola správna.

Pri vytočených chodidlách sú väzy na vonkajšej strane kolena a krížené väzy vo vnútri kolena uvoľnené a koleno stráca stabilitu. Koleno sa často potom prepadáva smerom dovnútra a nohy vyzerajú, že sú do X. Teda vlastne, nie len vyzerajú, ale sú.
Väzy na vnútornej strane sú potom príliš natiahnuté a pod stresom. (To bol aj môj prípad po dlhé roky.)
Bedrá

Teraz už sa od chodidiel dostávame poriadne ďaleko. Na úrovni bedrových kĺbov takéto vytočenie chodidiel znamená, že je ťažké zapojiť svaly zadku. Jednou z ich úloh je vytáčať stehennú kosť do vonka. Ak je stehno už vytočené, sval je v skrátenej polohe a nemá sa ako viac sťahovať, takže nič veľmi nerobí. Vtedy neplní ani svoju druhú úlohu, čo je odťahovanie nohy do strany. Možno by ste povedali, že to je pohyb, ktorý nepraktizujete často, ale pravdepodobne by ste sa mýlili. Tento pohyb je totiž potrebný pri chôdzi. Bez zapojenia svalov zadku sa nám potom kolená ešte viac stretávajú v strede a ešte viac sa opotrebovávajú.

Okrem kolien takýto lenivý zadok ovplyvňuje aj panvové dno a krížovú chrbticu. Kríže musia za neho kompenzovať a vieme, aké sú bolesti krížov časté. Panvové dno zasa oslabne a stuhne, lebo zadok funguje ako jeho partner. Svaly zadku aj panvového dna sa pripájajú na kostrč, zadok ju ťahá smerom dozadu a panvové dno dopredu. Keď zadok prestane ťahať, a keď si ešte k tomu často sedíme na kostrči, táto sa zatláča dnu a panvové dno sa skráti a slabne.

A to všetko len kvôli tomu, že stojíme s nohami do strán! Samozrejme, nie všetko sa u každého prejaví a nie hneď. Záleží aj na tom, ako veľmi sú chodidlá vytočené a kde presne sa to deje, či na úrovni bedrových kĺbov, kolien, členkov, alebo všade trošku.
Prečo tak veľa ľudí stojí s vytočenými nohami

V niektorých prípadoch sú do strany smerujúce nohy vrodené, ale to je veľmi zriedkavé. U maličkých detí je to normálne, lebo kĺby sa im ešte vyvíjajú. Väčšina dospelých to má však kvôli zvyku a tomu, ako svoje telá používame.
Len zvyk

Päty k sebe, špičky od seba je postoj, ktorý sa učil na telesnej výchove, na povinnej vojenskej službe, aj na balete. A pohyby, ktorým venujeme pozornosť začneme nakoniec používať aj v čase, keď nedávame pozor. Preto baletky chodia ako baletky aj keď nebaletia.

Navyše, od detstva okolo seba vidíme ľudí, ktorí chodia určitým spôsobom, a bez toho, aby sme si to uvedomili, sa náš pohyb učíme od nich. (Takže vaše “geneticky” zlé kolená, vbočené palce, či boľavý chrbát nemusia vôbec byť genetické, aj keď ich má celá rodina. Možno sa všetci iba rovnako hýbete.)
Topánky a sedenie

Ak by to nebolo dosť, sú tu aj ďalšie faktory, ktoré nás vedú k tomu, že vytáčame nohy do strán. Jedným z dôvodov môžu byť skrátené lýtkové svaly. Ak sú lýtkové svaly krátke, nevieme poriadne ohnúť členok a priblížiť prsty k píšťale (poznáte špička-fajka? tak fajka). Bez dostatočnej pohyblivosti členka je chôdza problém. Ak ale vytočíme chodidlá von, členok sa nepotrebuje toľko ohýbať a vieme nejako kráčať. A naše telá sa snažia splniť naše požiadavky na pohyb, aj keď im to dlhodobo môže ublížiť. Takže obetujú správne postavenie kĺbov, aby sme sa boli schopní hýbať. Lebo čo ak by nás naháňal medveď.

Ako sa nám môžu skrátiť lýtkové svaly? Nuž ľahko. Sedením a nosením topánok s podpätkom (nie len vysokým, aj “normálnym”). Pri nich sú totiž lýtkové svaly v skrátenej polohe, a keď tak trávia veľa času, potom také ostanú.

Ďalším problémom je nosenie tesných topánok, ktoré stláčajú prsty k sebe. Tým sa zmenšuje plocha, na ktorej stojíme, čiže strácame stabilitu. Stlačené prsty sa k tomu horšie hýbu a aj to zhoršuje stabilitu. Ako kompenzáciu často vytočíme nohu von, čo zväčšuje plochu, na ktorej stojíme. Klenba sa zníži a dotyková plocha so zemou je väčšia.

Ako si vyrovnať nohy

Dobrá správa je, že riešenie je vcelku jednoduché. Keďže vo väčšine prípadov je chodenie s nohami von zvyk, ide len o to zvyknúť si chodiť rovno. Nezaberá to žiaden extra čas, treba sa len sústrediť na to, ako sedíme, stojíme a chodíme.
Chodidlá paralelne

Postavte sa, a skúste nájsť na zemi dve paralelné čiary (dlaždičky, okraj koberca, skrine, knihy… Aj vy máte knihy na zemi?). Potom si vyrovnajte chodidlá tak, aby osi chodidiel (od päty ku začiatku ukazováka) boli paralelne. Neriaďte sa vnútornou hranou nohy. Ak sú tie paralelne, nohy sú vytočené do vonka. Riadte sa buď osou nohy, alebo vonkajšou hranou.

Čudné? Ja viem. Ja som si na začiatku myslela, že stratím rovnováhu. Ak je vám to veľmi nepríjemné, nemusíte to úplne vyrovnať naraz, stačí postupne. Je to len otázka zvyku. Čím viac pozornosti, a čím častejšie, tomu budete venovať, tým skôr si zvyknete a budete tak chodiť bez rozmýšľania.
Kolená dopredu

Keď už máte chodidlá vyrovnané, pozrite sa na kolená. Smerujú priamo dopredu, alebo k sebe? Ak si nie ste istí, skúste niekoho poprosiť, aby sa vám zozadu pozrel na kolenné jamky. Tie by mali smerovať priamo dozadu. Ak nesmerujú, skúste vytočiť stehenné kosti do vonka, bez toho aby ste zdvihli chodidlo. V prípade, že vám nejde nasmerovať koleno dopredu, budete musieť chodidlá vyrovnávať postupne, lebo nechceme opraviť chodidlo a pri tom pokaziť koleno. Takže vyrovnávajte len koľko sa dá.
Natiahnuť lýtkové svaly

Takmer každý dnes má skrátené lýtkové svaly, takže aby vás neobmedzovali, zaraďte do svojho dňa tento cvik.
Správne topánky

Nesmieme zabudnúť na topánky. Topánky by mali mať dostatočne širokú špičku, aby prsty mali dosť pohyblivosti, a aby celá noha bola dosť stabilná. V topánke by ste mali byť schopní prsty roztiahnuť. Na začiatok môže byť dobrá pomôcka obkresliť si bosú nohu s roztiahnutými prstami na papier a topánku na ňu postaviť. Ak noha pretŕča, topánka je určite príliš úzka. Schválne, otestujte si topánky, čo máte doma.

Keď už sme pri topánkach, pomôže aj nosiť topánky bez opätku, kvôli ktorým sa nám nebudú skracovať lýtkové svaly. O topánkach sa dá rozprávať strašne veľa, ale to niekedy nabudúce, lebo tento článok začína byť trochu dlhý. (Hurá, ten čas nakoniec prišiel a celý článok o topánkach nájdete tu.)
Na záver

Ak vás tento článok presvedčil, že nechcete chodiť s nohami na krivo, aby ste si ušetrili problémy s chodidlami, členkami, kolenami, bedrovými kĺbami, chrbtom a panvovým dnom (uf, ale toho je), tak tu je malá rekapitulácia, čo s tým.

I remember one time when I got a chance to jump on a trampoline. I was hopping up and down with joy and careless abandon and then suddenly it dawned on me that what I was enjoying is not a given for many people. I was there, 5 months after brithing my second kid, jumping on a trampoline like there was nothing to it. To be honest, it wasn't that easy in the first year after I had my first child. But I worked on it and got better.

Do you want to know a secret? I don't do kegels.

*** How the pelvic floor actually works
Most people imagine the pelvic floor like some sort of a trampoline with a hole in the middle. And this holy trampoline is somehow -- miraculously -- supposed to hold all our pelvic organs. Good luck, I say.

With this image in mind, the idea of kegels does seem pretty reasonable. But only for as long as we think of the pelvic floor as a trampoline floor isolated from other structures. 

Imagine a piece of fabric with a long slit in the middle. This will be our pelvic floor: it has a narrow opening that extends front to back, but isn't particularly wide.

#+attr_html: :alt A picture of a tissue with a long narrow slit in it.
#+caption: A tissue pelvic floor with a hole for all the tubes.

#+attr_html: :alt A drawint of the pelvic floor seen from the inside, which shows all the openings being in one line from the pubic bone to the tailbone.  
#+caption: A drawing of the pelvic floor seen from the inside. All the openings are in a line from the pubic bone to the tailbone.
[[file:kegel_pelvic-floor-drawing.jpeg]]

If we forget that the fabric is actually attached to something, the only way to keep the hole closed is to pull the edges of it together, a bit like a drawstring bag. And then hope to gods that the string holds with all its might. And that, dear reader, is a kegel.

#+attr_html: :alt A picture of the tissue with a slit and fingers trying to close the opening by pulling the edges of it together. 
#+caption: The opening is closed by pulling in the fabric edges, like a drawstring bag or a sphincter.
[[file:kegel_tissue-kegel.jpeg]]

Now let's make our idea of the pelvic floor a bit more accurate. Let's imagine that the fabric is attached to a frame on all sides and that this frame can expand and contract a little in the front-back direction. Because, yes, there is surprisingly much movement in our pelvises and the sacrum can tilt slightly in and out.

In this case, we can close the hole by simply pulling the fabric in the front-back direction. And there you have it!

#+attr_html: :alt A picture of the same tissue with a slit. This time, hands are pulling at the edges of a tissue, stretching it in the same direction as the slit. This shows the opening being closed. 
#+caption: Here you go, it's enough to pull instead of scrunching and the hole is closed.
[[file:kegel_tissue-lenghten.jpeg]]

You might be asking now how to pull the "fabric" of your pelvic floor in real life. Well, it's the gluteus maximus that does that -- the biggest of the glutes, the butt. It attaches to the tailbone and the sacrum from the outside, while the pelvic floor attaches from the inside. When the glutes are activated, they are pulling the tailbone outwards.

This actually happens during walking (or at least it should). It's a great way not just to close the holes, but also to train the pelvic floor. Having to resist the periodic stretching during every single step keeps it in good shape -- long, strong and elastic, just as it should be. And that's why our ancestors did ok even without a hundred kegels a day.

**** The pelvic floor is not a floor
If all of this confusion weren't enough, the pelvic floor is not actually a floor at all.

But if you try to search the web for "pelvic floor", you will find countless drawings just like this one, with the pelvic floor being horizontal and all of the organs sitting above it, magically propped up by their respective soft tubes.

#+attr_html: :alt A drawing of a side view of the pelvic area. The organs -- bladder, uterus and rectum, with their respective tubes (urethra and vagina) are perpendicular to the pelvic floor, positioned right above it. 
#+caption: This is how people usually draw the pelvic floor -- like a holy trampoline with all the organs jumping on it.
[[file:kegel_pelvis-drawing-wrong-eng.jpg]]

In reality, it doesn't look like that at all.

The pelvic floor attaches to the pubic bone in the front and to the tailbone and the sacrum in the back. Try to find your tailbone and your pubic bone and get them in the same horizontal plane. This is what it looks like for me. And this is not how anyone should walk around.

#+attr_html: :alt A photograph of a woman's torso from the side. Hands are pointing at the pubic bone and the tailbone, which are level. The pelvis is angled like that of a pooping dog. 
#+caption: This is what it looks like when I try to get the pubic bone and the tip of the tailbone into one horizontal level. All wrong.
[[file:kegel_pelvis-wrong.png]]

When you look at a pelvis oriented correctly, the pelvic floor isn't a "floor" at all. (But I will continue calling it a floor anyway, because I doubt that "pelvic wall" would catch on. Or what do you think?)

#+attr_html: :alt A drawing of the pelvis from the side. The organs (bladder, uterus, colon) seem to be lying on top of each other above the pubic bone, while the pelvic floor isn't horizontal, but rather diagonal. 
#+caption: The pelvic "floor" is more of a pelvic "wall" -- the organs are lying on top of each other above the pubic bone rather than above the pelvic floor itself. They don't need to be propped up by soft tubes.

#+attr_html :alt A photo of a woman's torso from the side, hands pointing at the pubic bone and tailbone, where the pubic bone is lower than the tailbone. The silhouette looks natural.
#+caption: Here you can see where my pubic bone and tailbone are when my pelvis is in neutral.
[[file:kegel_pelvis-right.png]]

And thank gods that the pelvic floor is not a floor! All of those images of organs bouncing on a trampoline full of holes make my sphincters clench. It looks as if the uterus was proped up by the vagina and the bladder by the urethra, while these soft tubes have no chance of propping up anything. But if you orient your pelvis right, the organs can just lie there comfortably stacked on top of each other and the pubic bone. Nothing will be falling out anywhere.

*** What the pelvic floor really needs
What does the pelvic floor expect then? What does it need in order to work well? Well, the short version is: correct breathing and a strong butt. Read on for the long version.

**** Breathing
The pelvic floor and the diaphragm relate to each other more than you might think. They form the walls of the same "balloon" -- the abdominopelvic cavity. The diapraghm is the ceiling and the pelvic floor is the floor/back wall. When the diapraghm depresses during an inhale, it increases the pressure in the cavity. The pelvic floor feels the pressure and has to activate to resist it.

If we don't breathe properly, problems show up. So breathing well is a surprising, but important step towards a healthy pelvic floor.
You can read more about breathing !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

**** Butt
As I mentioned before, the butt and the pelvic floor are partners that work together and workout together. Unfortunately, many aspects of our lives aren't very nice to our butts.

**** Sitting
One of the worst modern habits is the almost constant sitting in the same position. Most of the contraptions we sit in almost don't allow another way of sitting. We sit leaning back, lower back rounded, pelvis tucked under -- literally sitting on our tailbones and pushing them inwards. This is putting the pelvic floor in a shortened position, which means it has trouble closing anything. It has to adapt to this, so it shortens over time too and becomes tighter and tighter.

The take-away message here is -- don't sit on your tailbone. If you want to read more about sitting, you can check out my post about sitting. !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

**** Standing
Unfortunately, when we finally stand up from our lounging position, not all of our body parts stand up with us. No, this is not a ghost story, I'm just trying to say that too much sitting changes how our body works to the point that we aren't even able to stand right anymore.

Sitting, and especially if done in high heels (by which I mean anything higher than 0), leads to shortening of muscles on the back of the legs. It's a shortening that doesn't just go away when we stand up. Give them enough time in a seated position and they literally rebuild themselves.

As a result, most of us stand with our pelvis tucked under and often shoved forward as well. In this position, the muscles on the back of the legs are in their familiar short position.

Unfortunately, tucked pelvis is not good news.

When the pelvis is tucked, the butt can't work. The insertions of the muscles are in a position where they can't pull anything anywhere. This seriously compromises the stability of the pelvis, the efficiency of the gait and yes, the tug-of-war between the butt and the pelvic floor. The pelvic floor loses its partner.

To top it off, tucking the pelvis makes the pelvic floor into an actual horizontal floor, so now it has to carry more of the weight of the organs above. To keep everything in, it has to clench. And hold. And hold. But if the butt isn't pulling from the other side, the pelvic floor just ends up dragging the tailbone inward. And so its own frame is getting smaller and it has to get smaller with it. Clench and hold.

The poor pelvic floor is clenching, shortening and holding with all its might, but muscle contractions become less and less effective as the muscle is shortened. (It has to do with the overlapp of the fibers in them, but that is a topic for another day.) The overworked pelvic floor becomes stiff and we finally start noticing the trouble -- pain, incontinence, prolapse.

And that's why a tucked pelvis is a disaster for the pelvic floor.

**** Why not kegels
The pelvic floor is supposed to be strong and supple. It needs to react to breathing, pull of other muscles around and changes in the pressure in the abdominopelvic cavity.

Due to our modern lives, most of us are using our pelvic floor wrong. We turn it into a "floor" by tucking the pelvis and we don't let it play with its friends -- the butt and the diaphragm. We end up with a pelvic floor that is shortened, stiff and overworked. As a result, it can't contract as it should, so we /think/ it's /weak/.

Unfortunately, what kind of advice will the owner of this poor pelvic floor get? In 99/100 cases, that would be kegels. And what do kegels do? Assuming a weak pelvic floor, a kegel is supposed to make it stronger by regular contractions.

And so the chronicly contracted, shortened, stiff and overworked pelvic floor gets a regular regime of /more/ contracting and shortening. Because a kegel is just like tightening the string on a drawstring bag -- it completely misses the actual problem most people have.

It usually works for a while. Training will increase the strength of the pelvic floor, so it becomes better able to work in these horrible conditions. The symptoms will improve temporarily, but are likely to come back, because the real problem is only getting worse.

Plus, let's be honest, kegels are a funny one. Why should we even need such a strange exercise? For most issues, functional exercises tend to provide the most benefit. The kind of movement that make sense in context: in daily life or sports. Just because we strenghten a muscle using an isolated exercise, doesn't mean it will activate when it should in real life. Movement is as much about the brain as it is about muscles.

**** When kegels are the right solution
Some people might benefit from kegels, if their pelvic floor is actually weak. Although, even in this case, the kegels should be paired with other exercises and lifestyle changes.

Kegels can also help us to "get to know" our pelvic floor muscles and learn to activate them. For this purpose, the quality of the exercise matters much more than the quantity. And most people are doing kegels wrong: using either the wrong muscles, or focusing only on the contraction, while the release is at least equally important.

If you believe kegels might be the right thing for you, I encourage you to find a good pelvic floor physiotherapist who can make sure that it really is what you need and that you do them right.

**** If not kegels, then what?
Pelvic floor dysfunction is one of our floppy fins. Just like orcas in captivity often end up with a bent-over dorsal fin, humans in the modern world often end up with pelvic floor issues. The reason is the same, lack of the mechanical inputs that our bodies evolved with, rely on and take for granted. (You can read more about floppy fins here !!!!!!!!!!!!!)

How can we get a healthy, supple and strong pelvic floor without kegels?

You already have a part of the answer. It's good breathing, sitting and standing (especially the position of the pelvis, which I wrote about more here as well !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!)

Good posture puts the pelvic floor in a position where it can work. The next step is to give it enought opportunities to do just that.

Walking and squatting are among the best movements that optimally engage the pelvic floor. They both involve the whole body and have been ubiquitous in the lives of our ancestors for millions of years. When we lack either or both, we begin hurting in many different places, but the pelvic floor is one of the first victims.

I wrote more about the basic movements that we are missing here !!!!!!!!!!!

So how is your relationship with kegels? You can let me know if you feel like it.

*** Can I drop my body off at the gym and pick it up when it's done?


As a teenager I used to always listen to music or audiobooks when I went for a run. I did it because running and exercise were a chore - a boring, annoying, but necessary chore. I didn't do it for the fun of it. I just wanted to lose weight and get into shape (mostly so that I would be able to run away from the aliens if I found myself in an episode of Doctor Who). I loved the feeling I got after running, but definitely not during. 

It's common to see exercise as a chore that we just want to get over with, but today I will tell you about all the reasons why a focused movement practice is good for not only your body, but also your brain. 

*** I move, therefore I am

When we talk about movement, we often think of musculoskeletal system - the muscles and the bones. We tend to forget that there is one more very important system involved: the nervous system. 

If I want to drink my tea, I just reach my hand, pick up the cup, bring it to my mouth and drink. No real thinking required. But even such a seemingly simple movement requires an incredibly well coordinated effort from a large number of muscles. Everything needs to be just right. Just the right strength of a contraction at just the right time. And that's what the brain is there for.

#+begin_quote
Movement might actually be the reason why we have a brain at all! 
#+end_quote


According to one theory, animals evolved a brain in order to be able to freely move through their environment. The complex interactions with one's surroundings simply required a brain. Plants manage without one, but they usually don't get very far. Even for us humans, a species that likes to use our brains for a bunch of stuff, movement still takes up a massive part of its capacity. 

*** Your brain prefers dancing over sudoku

I have nothing against sudoku, but if you would like to train your brain then movement can get you better results. There are [[https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa022252][studies that look specifically at the effect of dancing on the cognitive abilities and dementia risk in elderly people]]. The effects are overwhelmingly positive and the best out of the tested activities, followed by crossword puzzles and reading. Biking, swimming and golf however didn't make much of a difference. 

#+begin_quote
What is it about dancing that was so beneficial for the brain? The most likely answer is that it was the need to learn new things and to constantly react and adjust to the music and the dancing partner. 
#+end_quote

In dancing there is a tight feedback loop involved in dancing. The brain needs to carefully monitor the inputs - music, partner, space, own body, and decide how to react to it. There are many possibilities and often new moves. The environment is complex and our movement through it is complex. It is what the brain is so good at and also what is good for it. 

I would guess that dancing isn't the only type of movment that could provide this benefit, although I can't back it up by any studies, as most focus on ballroom dancing. But we can experience similar movement complexity and interactions with our environment in other situations too. A hike through a challengening terrain, balancing, climbing a tree. Maybe even an artificial obstacle course. 

*** We are what we focus on the most

As  the saying goes: practice makes perfect.  But only under one important condition. The practice has to be focused.  
Our brain is able to perform familiar movements on autopilot.  It simply starts the stored program and executes the pattern.  It’s  fast and efficient.  But what if the pattern blueprint isn’t correct?  Well in that case we will be practicing and training the incorrect movement over and over again. 

To improve,  we need to establish a feedback loop. The brain needs to be  continuously adjusting the movement  in reaction  to the feedback it receives.  That requires focus. 

We can hack this focus with certain types of movements,  the kind that just won’t work if we’re not responsive enough.  And  that brings us back to the ballroom dancing.  But also balancing.  If you do it wrong,  you fall.  Hiking  in  terrain that isn’t flat and level  requires a  similar amount of focus and  continuous response to the environment.  Jumping rope  also provides an immediate feedback forcing you to do it well or not at all.

With many other movements it’s up to us to bring in the focus and awareness.

The good news is,  that the focus is our key to improving the quality of our movements.  If  a  movement pattern stored in our brain isn’t good enough,  all we need is focused practice to imprint a  new pattern.  And  although it does take time,  the more we practice, the faster it happens.

*** Play, practice, train

One of the foundations of good and safe movement is self-awareness.  We all have our limitations, but being aware of them is what allows us to use our full abilities and  reduce the risk of injuries. 


#+begin_quote
How to build good movement? Play, practice, train. In that order. With self-awareness.
#+end_quote

The ultimate way to develop self-awareness is play. Play is an exploration. An exploration of one's own abilities, of the environment and how they can play together. In play, we test our boundaries, we feel what feels right and we experiment with various ways of doing the same. It allows us to know ourselves and to find what works. 

Only then can we move onto practice. Practice is deliberate and focused. Now that we have explored the possibilities through play, we know better where we want to get. We can then start practicing the movements. Focusing on the feedback from our bodies and our environment and using it to refine the movement. 

Training is the last step that only makes sense after we have been through play and practice stages. Now that we have a correct movement pattern blueprint in the brain, we can start adding intensity to it, whether through higher loads, speeds or number of repetitions. 

For most people who aren't athletes, the play and practice stages are the most important. They train the brain the most, they help us develop self-awareness, correct movement patterns and despite what it might soud like, they do also train and strenghten the muscles. Plus, it's where most of the fun is.

#+begin_quote
Nobody would dream of leaving their brain behind when going to practice playing a  music instrument.  Practicing movement isn’t really that different.

*** Disconnected and dysfunctional

I used to be a nerdy little bookworm as a kid and as a teenager. And honestly a bit of a couch potato. If I could sit in a comfy armchair with a book, I would sit in a comfy armchair with a book.

I also used to be a "good girl". Doing what I was expected to do and following the rules both spoken and implied. So I would sit "properly", never run around in the corridors and favour academic achievements over physical prowess.

It was subconcious - I never really decided not to move - but it was happening and it had consequences.

I was just 12 when a doctor told me that my knee pain was due to worn cartilages and there was nothing to do about it. By the time I entered my twenties I not only had bad knees, but also a wonky ankle, flat feet and regular lower back pain.

And I don't think I even understood how much it affected me mentally...

I wasn't happy with the way I looked and I ingored as best as I could the way I felt in my own body.

[[file:move_more_better_Nori_2013_576x1024.png]]

*** It changed, thankfully

It happened in 2015. The beginning of the change, I mean. It was a cold Norwegian January and I was an ever-so-nerdy bookish PhD student. That day I went to a proper gym - probably for the first time in my life. I was suffering from a new-years-resolutionitis and had a vague feeling I should "start exercising (somehow)". I was looking for something that would require as little energy and time as possible.

Well that trip to the gym never repeated itself. But boy oh boy, was it an eye-opener. I was weak, clumsy, awkward and stiff. I had no idea how to move.

Thankfully, I had enough self-awareness left to realize I had no control and was on my way to an injury.

Coming home that day, I started searching the internet. Trying to answer questions like why can't I squat? And this was the real beginning. The nerd's way.

I was studying biophysics and suddenly realized that the mechanics of the human body was actually right up my alley!

I loved reading about it. And I still do!

And before I knew it, I was applying what I was reading to myself and eventually advising others. Also reading more, taking courses, and learning more.

Movement became my passion.

*** Reconnecting with myself

I don't go to the gym. I don't really play sports. I have a full time job and two kids and I don't enjoy gyms and sports enough to make time for them.

Instead I just move.

I make space for movement in my daily life and in my mind, because I know now that it is essential.

My movement practice keeps me
pain free, confident,
moving with ease,
able to enjoy physical activity and
connected to my body and the world around me.

I finally feel at home in my body. I finally feel like I belong. And it's a good feeling.

:END:

I don’t eat a “varied and balanced diet” anymore. I don’t do five a day. There is no rainbow on my plate. And no holy (whole)  grains.  Zero fibre,  actually. On the other hand, I eat lots of saturated fat, cholesterol and salt. 

I eat meat, eggs, fish, salt and water. And that's pretty much it 99% of the time. 

And believe it or not I have never felt better.  

How did I get here? Let us start from the middle...

*** No matter how hard I tried, everything was wrong

My first daugther was a bit over a year old and I was having probably the most difficult time of my life. 

Most people would consider our diet at that time very healthy. It was full of fruits and vegetables, whole grains, heart-healthy plant fats and only relatively small amounts of meat. Everything was prepared at home from fresh ingredients. 

**** Child with alergies

We didn't really have much choice. From the moment the kiddo was born, it was quite clear that she inherited her mother's disposition for allergies. We quickly identified milk and eggs as the main culprit and I dropped them from my diet like a hot potato, because I didn't want to stop breastfeeding her. 

But that wasn't enough. She kept reacting to random things I ate. And when she started solids also to the things she ate. It was a nightmare trying to identify the culprits and medical testing provided only some answers, and clearly not all. So I kept eliminating more and more foods from my diet. 

She was actually doing very well for a child with allergies - most likely thanks to the breastmilk - but I on the other hand... not so much. 

**** I started falling apart
#+attr_html: :alt A picture of a woman with long hair, in a tank top, sitting by a dining table, smiling at the camera with a bowl of oatmeal in front of her. Her arms are somewhat thin and there are slight bags under her eyes. 
#+caption: That is oatmeal in my bowl. January 2018, 8 months post partum. Tired.
[[file:carnivore_Nori2018_411x637.jpg]]


It slowly crept up on me, but by the time she was a year, I was hardly recognising myself. I was skinny, weak, perpetually tired and always sick.  Any virus passing by would get me and keep me miserable for many weeks. I even managed to break two of my ribs in a coughing fit.  Really.  

My hands were covered in eczema I couldn’t get rid of for ages. My digestion was miserable. I was having so much bloating and unexpected trips to the bathroom that it was often difficult to leave the house.  But the worst of it was the mental part. I was anxious and angry and scared. Sometimes I didn't even know why. I was just not coping at all.

According to my doctor, everything looked fine. 

*** Just meat? Are you out of your gourd?

It continued for way too long without much improvement. Until one day in May 2019, when I was 30 years old and the little one has just turned two. 

And here I have to give credit to my husband who showed me a [[https://imgur.com/gallery/mkzQ6Kk][picture of married couple]] he found online and asked me how old I though they were. I guessed maybe late thirties, at most early fourties. I was super wrong. She was 46 and he was 61. 

And they attributed their youthfull looks and good health to only having eaten beef for the last 20 years. 

**** Carnivore

The people in the picture were [[https://www.allthingscarnivore.com/joe-and-charlene-andersons-carnivore-diet-experience/][Joe and Charlene Andersen]] and as we quickly found out, they are far from the only ones following some version of the so-called carnivore diet, and reporting incredible health benefits. 

#+begin_quote
Carnivore... as in no plant foods at all. I was flabbergasted. It can't be!
#+end_quote


I mean, everyone knows, that vegetables are nutrition, right? You can't live without vegetables!

#+begin_quote
Or?
#+end_quote


Turns out you can. And more than that. You can thrive. We discovered a big community of carnivores online, quite a few of them doctors, researchers and dieticians. And so many stories from all sorts of people. They often sounded like miracles. People who went into remission from their "uncurable" chronic diseases, from eczemas, depression, anxiety, through Crohn's, type 2 diabetes, psoriasis, juvenile arthritis, to epilepsy, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and tooth cavities...

Some even had their grey hair grow dark again. 

#+begin_quote
I usually follow the rule that if something sound too good to be true, then it probably isn't true. 
#+end_quote

*** But there wasn't much to lose this time. 

Of course I didn't go in blindly. I read and I read and I double-checked and carefully considered arguments from all the sides. I was a PhD student at the time and let me tell you, a PhD is mostly a degree in reading scientific literature. So that is what I did here too. And things did check out and did make sense. The last thing left was to try. 

My personal little miracle 

We were going to try it for a month. It has now been over 3 years. It really felt like experiencing my own little miracle. 

#+attr_html: :alt A picture of a woman in a black dress holding a child on her hip, standing by a Christmas tree.

#+begin_quote
I do indeed thrive.
#+end_quote


- *Digestion* - better than ever. And it used to be really bad. Now I don't think about 99% of the time. Have you ever experienced zero bloat? It's glorious.

- *Skin* - better than ever. Eczema was gone within a week and acne a few weaks later. Plus I don't burn in the sun anymore. Go figure. 

- *Pollen allergies* - basically gone. As long as I am perfectly plant free (including spices) I don't experience any symptoms. And I used to have terrible allergies fo 9 months out of a year!

- *Mental health* - much better. I didn't realize I used to have anxiety until it was gone. The impending sense of doom now only returns when I eat some sugar. 

- *Resistance to getting sick* - definitely better. I still get sick, seeing that I live with two small people that will gladly sneeze in your eyeball and that visit a breeding gourn for pathogens daily (a.k.a. kindergarten). But the illnesses are milder and pass much faster. 


Over the last three years I have been experimenting with adding other foods to my diet and every time I end up going back to a pure carnivore of meat, fish, eggs, salt and water. Because many of the benefits I mentioned here disappear for me, once I add some plant foods. Some people don't feel a difference from adding some coffee or avocado or spices or other plants, but I really do. 

And for as long as this will make me feel the best, I will continue. 

#+begin_quote
The carnivore diet and how and why it works has remained a source of fascination for me. I have never before experienced such a profound change. I wouldn't hesitate to say that carnivore saved my life. And it all makes sense. 

And that's why I just can't keep it to myself.

I really really tried to start an online business, but it was just an endless struggle. I just couldn't get myself to do the things and I couldn't get it right. And so I finally stopped. It was a relief and a disappointment at the same time. And it actually took me close to a year to figure out what went "wrong", and why it's for the best. 

If you are looking for a guide on how to start making money online, this is not it. This is me tracing back my steps, trying to figure out where and why I "failed". And the short story is: It didn't agree with me. The long story is… well, longer:

*** A course that was supposed to save me

It was at a time in my life when I was seriously struggling with balancing work and family. I had a small child that needed my presence more than the average toddler, but I just had to go back to work, there was no other choice. So I was drowning in guilt, fatigue and tears (both mine and hers).

#+begin_quote
I wanted a way out.
#+end_quote


And that way out seemed to appear on Instagram, out of all places. Some of the people I was following mentioned having gone through a life-changing course about starting an online business. So I followed the account of the lovely lady who runs it. And at first I didn't think it was the right thing for me, but with each passing post and each passing month, I was getting more and more convinced to give it a try.

I followed for about a year before I signed up. I already had a blog from before (which was just for fun), and I felt I had things to say. So why not?

#+begin_quote
I gave it my all.
#+end_quote

I was posting on my blog, on Facebook, on Instagram, sending a newsletter, I had several "free" ebooks that I exchanged for people's email addresses and at the end of the course, I had my paid ebook. I was proud of it. It was good.

#+begin_quote
And then I hit a wall.*
#+end_quote

I couldn't get myself to promote my ebook. I couldn't get myself to mention it on social media. I kept lowering the price of my ebook every few weeks. I lost steam completely. I tried to pick up where I left again and again, thinking it was writer's block or imposter syndrome or whatever, but I just couldn't get myself to write and post with any regularity again. There were months between each addition and writing was a pain.

Eventually, I stopped. I felt like a failure. I had all the tools necessary to get this to work, and I have seen other people who made it. But not me. I simply wasn't good enough.

At least that is how I felt for a very long time.

*** Making people want

I learned a lot from the course.

Did you know that most people buy only after five or more contacts with the seller? And that marketers are deliberately appealing to our feelings and telling us how their product will make us feel and how it will change our lives? That they know we are more likely to buy under time pressure, so they come up with time-limited offers, real or fake?

It's nothing new, really. Nothing ground-breaking. It's like those fabric softener ads on TV that show people running through fields of flowers, rather than telling you that it will make your towels soft and smell like some chemical approximation of flowers. A bit ridiculous, right?

I kind of knew or suspected many of it before, but reading it black on white was a little jarring. Still, I tried to do it too, but I was really bad at it. I just couldn't do it properly. It was a topic in the course too, actually: "I am bad at selling". We were told we deserved to be paid for our efforts and for all the value we were providing for people. After all, the money would allow us to make more content. It was a reciprocal relationship. And all of that makes perfect sense, of course. But I was still failing miserably.

**** It's magic

It's only recently that I started looking at it from the other side though. From the side of a customer. We all know marketing and ads are fake and manipulative, yet we all think we are immune to them. I admit I did. I thought I wouldn't let something like that influence my choices. 

Then I read about Tristan Harris - a technology ethicist, vocal critic of social media and founder of the [[https://www.humanetech.com/][Center for Humane Technology]]. He compared social media to magicians. We all know magicians are using tricks and we are often trying to look for it, yet almost all of us get fooled over and over again. It has nothing to do with intelligence. They are simply using our inherent human "weaknesses", the way our brain works, to trick us. But while magicians do it for our delight, social media and ads do it for other reasons. Why would companies use as much money as they do for advertising, if it didn't work?

#+begin_quote
Manipulation doesn't stop working just because we know we are being manipulated.
#+end_quote

**** Social media work for marketers

Tristan Harris is featured in the Netflix documentary The Social Dilemma and also in Johann Hari's book Stolen Focus. I enjoyed Stolen Focus tremendously, and while it covers a lot more ground than just social media, they are one of the main topics. At the time when I was reading the book I was feeling overwhelmed and like I had too many tabs open in my brain. Stolen Focus inspired me to quit social media and it actually helped.

Ever wondered how social media make money? We, the end users, are certainly not paying them. Their business model relies on money from ads. The marketers are their real customers, while our eyeballs are the product. In order to make advertisers happy, social media need to keep us scrolling for as long as possible (to see the most ads), and preferably to buy as well. They don't care whether we feel good being there, or angry and upset, as long as we are there. 

In my online business course, I learned a lot about how Facebook was this wonderful money machine. How easy it was to target the right people, how it would learn who to show the ads to and how for every cent you throw in for ads, you get two back. (Given you manage to write a good ad, which I never could, but that's not the point.)

Social media are full of people trying to sell. We are interacting with ads without even knowing they are ads. They might not be selling anything in that post, just getting us ready to buy in a day or a week. It's sneaky. And it works.

*** Selling dreams

#+begin_quote
I started wondering how much I was influenced by these subtle and less subtle ads.
#+end_quote

What about the course I was so sad about not being able to buy, since it cost 2000 euros? If my brain wasn't massaged for more than a year, would I have even wanted it? What course is even worth 2000 euros? Would my life have been easier if I have never heard about it? Would it be so life-changinly (I know it's not a word) worth it, if I had bought it? I don't have answers. Just questions.

Would I have bought that online business course, expensive as it was, if I weren't looking at all the posts about traveling, exotic places, spending time with family, all while making money? The word freedom popping up over and over again? Did I want to learn and do online marketing? Or did I want the freedom? Because freedom can't really be sold. The real product was a course about online marketing. What made me want to buy it was the vision of freedom. I wanted the result, not the journey.

Now, I don't want to throw any shade on that particular course and its author. It's a good course that worked for a good number of people and she never recommends anything outright unethical. I think she has more integrity than most marketers. She is also honest about the course not being a magic bullet and about success requiring a lot of hard work, time and dedication. She never lies about things.

And yet. And yet I wonder how many of us get seduced by the regular images of far-away places and vague promise of freedom. 

#+begin_quote
Seduced by posts written by a skilled marketer, delivered to us several times a day by powerful algorithms behind social media.
#+end_quote


I'm not saying it's unethical. I'm just realizing how susceptible I am to the marketing magic. And I'm realizing it's not something I would be ok with doing, personally. I don't want to make people want things, I don't want to create desires that might not have been there, just to sell my stuff. Whether I deserve the reward or not. I think there is already too much wanting in this world.

*** Gift economy

I realize I am talking from a place of privilege. I have a stable, full-time job that I love and that provides enough money for a fairly comfortable life. Nothing extra, no exotic places, but safety and security. I have good affordable childcare and two little kids that enjoy spending their time there. I don't really need a side hustle. I have the choice. I am well aware that not everyone does.

Sometimes I wish though that the world would be a bit different. A bit kinder and gentler, less eager to make quick and easy money. I read an absolutely wonderful book - Braiding Sweetgrass by Robin Wall Kimmerer. It's very difficult to say what that book is about. Robin is a botanist and a Native American and in Braiding Sweetgrass she talks a lot about plants, about nature and about our relationship with them from the point of view of indigenous peoples. It's an incredibly beautiful book full of wisdom and love.

I never thought I would be reminded of Braiding Sweetgrass while thinking of online marketing, but here we are. One of the ideas Robin introduces is gift economy. 

#+begin_quote
Gift economy. A world where every living thing freely shares their gifts with the others, and in return receives gifts with gratitude and respect for the giver. A world of reciprocity. A world where one doesn't just ask: "what can I get?", but mostly: "what can I give?". A world where gifts are appreciated and treasured.
#+end_quote

The plentiful bounty of Americas at the time when European colonizers arrived wasn't an accident. It was the result of careful stewardship of the land by the native peoples. It was gift economy between humans and nature in practice. It was the result of honorable harvest - never taking more than is given, never taking more than a half, giving back in return,…

Can you imagine a harvest where you only harvest half?! Crazy. And beautiful.

Now I know the world is headed in the opposite way nowadays, but that doesn't mean I have to follow. And so I am quite content with my short-lived venture into the competitive world of online business being over. It wasn't for me.

And since I have the luxury of "failing" at selling, I can do this instead. Go back to having a blog, just for fun. Freely sharing my gifts with anyone who might benefit, doing my part in the gift economy.
#+end_verse

I never thought I would be reminded of Braiding Sweetgrass while thinking of online marketing, but here we are. One of the ideas Robin introduces is gift economy. A world where every living thing freely shares their gifts with the others, and in return receives gifts with gratitude and respect for the giver. A world of reciprocity. A world where one doesn't just ask: "what can I get?", but mostly: "what can I give?". A world where gifts are appreciated and treasured.

I have recently finished reading Malcolm Kendrick's books /The Great Cholesterol Con/ and /The Clot Thickens/ and it was a treat. It was insightful, captivating and so very funny, just dripping with dry, British humour. And with frustration. A LOT of frustration.

*** What causes heart disease?
**** The cholesterol hypothesis
He is on a mission to tell people that the cholesterol hypothesis of cardiovascular disease is wrong.

#+begin_quote
The cholesterol hypothesis:
1. The amount of saturated fat we eat increases the level of LDL (Low Density Lipoprotein) particles in the blood.
2. High level of LDL in the blood leads to the creation of atherosclerotic plaques (which is basically what we call cardiovascular disease).
   - A hypothesis not as unanimously accepted as one might think.
#+end_quote

(By the way, if you know a slightly different version of this, such as switching out LDL for apoB, or saturated fat for cholesterol or for lack of unsaturated fat, well, yes, they keep changing the hypothesis to stay ahead of all the facts that contradict it. But it's still the same thing.)

The poor guy has already written several scientific papers and two books for the general public trying to debunk the cholesterol hypothesis (/The Great Cholesterol Con/ is one of them) and not much has changed. So he also wrote a book trying not as much to debunk the cholesterol hypothesis, but rather offer a better one. One that makes more sense. And that's what /The Clot Thickens/ is about.

**** The blood clot hypothesis
What, if not cholesterol/saturated fat/LDL causes atherosclerosis? As Malcolm Kendrick points out, that is not actually a good question to ask. A better question is "How?". Or to put it another way: "What is the process leading to atherosclerosis?". And the hypothesis he puts forward is that the atherosclerotic plaques are remnants of old blood clots. And there are many, many things that can cause these blood clots and so there are many, many "causes" to atherosclerosis.

It does fit the facts pretty nicely. From what the plaques contain and how they are organised, to how they grow, what happens when they rupture and down to the biggest well-known and less well-known risk factors for heart disease. It all fits.

I am not going to go into the details of it right now, any interested reader can find the books and read all the science and detailed explanations for themselves (and did I mentioned the books are super funny?). I think one day I will write about this more though, to sort out my thoughts, but don't hold your breath, I don't have a good track record of publishing often.

Anyway, there was something else I wanted to write about today,

*** How can there be such a huge disagreement?
Malcolm Kendrick is clearly a very smart, very well educated doctor who has studied the topic for many years and he is in opposition to what the consensus on cardiovascular disease is. And while he is far from alone in this, the cholesterol sceptics are in the minority.

And this is not a disagreement on some small details, no, this is as fundamental a disagreement as can be. And it would be unwise to disregard one side of the argument only because they are in the minority (or the majority, for that matter). 

#+begin_quote
For the majority to be wrong is a very normal situation in the history of not only science and medicine, but all of humankind. 
#+end_quote

The arguments put forward by Dr. Kendrick make a lot of sense and show a lot of holes in the cholesterol hypothesis. (Big holes, btw. Big. Holes.) Holes that get very nicely filled by the blood clot hypothesis.

But, I like to hear out all sides of an argument and so I went ahead and started reading. I looked at both peer-reviewed scientific papers and at what experts, such as Dr. Thomas Dayspring, have to say on the matter on social media.  Because, I thought, surely, these other smart, educated doctors and researchers who defend the cholesterol hypothesis must have some good arguments for it.

And they do. Sort of.

It's just that these arguments have a very different focus.

*** How? or Why?
Digging into the cholesterol hypothesis, it felt like it lost the sight of the forest for the trees. I learned about receptors that help transport cholesterol from the gut and into the cells of the gut wall, and about other ones that can toss it back out; I learned about receptors that start the transport of LDL particles through the endothelial cells (the cells that line the insides of the blood vessels) into the wall of he blood vessel; I read about how laminar and turbulent flow affect the proteoglycan content in the blood vessel walls; I read about the different reactions that can happen to LDL once it's in the wall...

There was a lot of detail (and little that would tie it to actual outcomes in people). But even in the papers and talks that were supposed to provide an overview, it all felt disjointed. "We know about this bit, and that bit, and a few more. And there is /stuff/ happening between them." I couldn't help but think: "Yes, you showed this, but what does it /mean/? Does it even relate to this next bit? Where is the bigger picture?"

#+begin_quote
It seems like the "proper" science is not supposed to ask why. Only concern itself with the how. 
#+end_quote

Don't get me wrong. The /how/ is bloody important. And I have written a few papers in my life and know how science and modern publishing work, I have no illusions there. It's tricky enough to defend the tiny /hows/ one manages to disentangle from the complexity of life, venturing into guessing about the /why/ is thin ice, and almost feels a bit... unscientific?

But the /why/ matters a lot. Let me explain on an example:

**** Why do LDL particles cross the endothelium?
Initially, when the cholesterol hypothesis came to be, it was thought that LDL particles just passively diffused through the endothelial cells and got stuck inside the arterial wall underneath them. If you know anything about cells, you might know that they are not very fond of just letting things diffuse through them (thank gods), and they are very picky about what they let through and what they don't. And that is actually the case here as well.

We do have enough evidence now to know that LDLs don't /just/ float through the cells. No, the cells manufacture a receptor, catch themselves an LDL particle, pull it in, move it through and spit it out on the other side. Well, we are quite sure of the catching and pulling-in part, slightly less sure of the spitting out part, but it seems like it does happen. Anyway, even the mainstream view has now admitted that this process is an active one and not passive, as it was assumed before.

#+begin_quote
The endothelial cell actively pulls in an LDL particle and moves it through itself to the other side.
#+end_quote

Why is this a big deal? Well, if the process had been passive, one could imagine that having too much LDL in the blood would make too much of it go through the wall. But if the cells decide themselves and if they have to use energy and actually work to get it through, it's not an accident.

#+begin_quote
Why are they doing it? Why are they moving it at all? Why so much? Is it just to give us heart disease?
#+end_quote

And this, /this/, is where I think the main difference between the proponents and opponents of the cholesterol hypothesis lies.

Because, I believe, most people who are in favour of the cholesterol hypothesis would tell you it doesn't matter why. 

*** It's a life philosophy
I think it comes down to how one sees the human body and actually the nature itself. Whether you believe it's "made" well or whether you feel like it's lucky that it works at all.

And this is not really a question of religion. We could have been well-made by millions of years of evolution just as well as by a higher power.

#+begin_quote
But that's what it boils down to. Do we trust that the body we have is mostly trying to do the right thing? Or do we think it's held together by pure luck - a mix of random happy accidents and countless mistakes, a ticking bomb waiting to explode on us?
#+end_quote

Because if you believe the body makes sense, then the question /why/ it's doing something is highly relevant, especially if it's happening in virtually everyone.

*** The cholesterol gamble
The issue with LDL is that practically all of us will have to choose at some point. The mainstream cardiovascular disease prevention and treatment has been steadily reducing what is considered to be a normal blood level of LDL particles. There are those who think we should all be chewing on statins. Unless this changes, we will all one day be told by our doctor that our "cholesterol" is too high and we should get on the statins.

I have been reading and listening to many people smarter than me from both sides and, while I keep my mind open, I know what makes the most sense to me. It will be a well-informed decision when I one day refuse a statin, if ever offered to me. It's still a gamble, of course, but taking the statin would be too.

To be honest, Malcolm Kendrick quite convinced me that the cholesterol hypothesis doesn't hold water. But what definitely doesn't make sense to me is this idea that we need to micromanage our bodies with medications and unnatural lifestyle changes to keep them from going off the rails and getting us killed.

And if I'm wrong, so be it. I will rather live in a world where my body is on my side, than one where I have to fear it.

*** Hello, my name is Nori, and I am an addict.

For the longest time, I didn't want to admit it to myself. I thought I was in control. I thought I was "moderating", whatever that might mean. But in truth I was moderating myself to a serving of my drug of choice dozens of times every day. Simply because I wouldn't feel good without it. Simply because I /wanted/ it. A lot. 

There were times when I would have so much I would make myself feel completely sick. Heart beating uncomfortably fast, body breaking out in cold sweat, headaches, nausea, dry mouth and unquenchable thirst. When I would wake up the next morning, after what was always a bad night of sleep, most of the unpleasantness would still be there (and more).

One time I spent the whole night throwing up, until I finally fell asleep on the bathroom floor. When I woke up some two hours later, utterly miserable, my first thoughts went to whether I had any more left. 

You might think that all that yuckiness would have detered me from having more. I would have thought so at least. But it didn't. Not one bit. I wanted more. I /needed/ more.

*** White powder
Are you wondering what my drug of choice is? You are not going to like the answer. Just how I didn't like it.

It is a substance extracted from certain plants, that, when ingested, stimulates the same regions in the brain as cocaine and amphetamines, giving you a dopamine high. Unfortunately, eating bigger amounts of this substance makes the brain more and more used to it. And getting too much of it damages the blood vessels over time, increasing massively the risk of cardiovascular, kidney and Alzheimer's diseases. It also leads to insulin resistance, causing type 2 diabetes, increasing risk of cancer, fertility problems, gastrointestinal issues, fatty liver disease... just to mention a few. It affects the /whole/ body.

It sounds nasty, doesn't it?
Yet we eat it daily. Heck, we feed it to our kids even more than ourselves.

Did you guess?

It's sugar.

And yes, it really does work similarly to a drug in the brain. [[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1931610/][Researchers found that rats would even prefer sugar, and surprisingly also artificial sweetener, over cocaine]]. [[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2235907/][Others have found the same - rats addicted to sugar with typical addict behavious of bingeing, withdrawal and craving, and the related changes in the chemistry of brain.]] [[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002822310006449][Dr. Robert Lustig who has spent a big chunk of his career researching fructose compares it to alcohol]] because of how the metabolism of the two is similar and how they both affect our behaviour. (Did you know, that both alcohol and fructose consumption lead to fatty liver and in worst case liver cirrhosis?) Several others ([[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2235907/][Nicole Avena et. al]], [[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28835408/][James DiNicolantonio et. al]], [[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23719144/][Serge Ahmed et. al]]) have written about the addictive potential of sugar. 

We know that [[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1499267115300721][sugar is one of the main factors behind our insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes epidemic]]. There is also evidence that [[https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/01.CIR.98.5.398][insulin resistance is a bit of a prerequisite for cardiovascular disease]]. [[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7246646/][Alzheimer's disease has been called type 3 diabetes]] and it seems it [[https://insulinresistance.org/index.php/jir/article/view/15][could be caused by an insulin resistant brain not being able to get the nutrition it needs]]. Insulin resistance (from too much sugar consumption) also increases the risk and deadliness of several cancers, like [[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32530506/][breast cancer]], [[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12509402/][prostate cancer]] and [[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11535544/][colorectal cancer]].

So yes, sugar is a drug, and a dangerous one at that.

*** Natural this - natural that, moderation, and other fairy tales
Now I can almost hear you protesting.

/But sugar is natural!/ Yes, just like cocaine, alcohol and cyanide.

/But our bodies need it!/ Well, they actually don't. You can very well live a life eating zero(!) carbs. There are both essential amino acids and essential fats that we /need/ to have in our diet to survive, but there are no essential carbs. If you think about how the Inuits used to live, or how our ancestors probably lived during the Ice Ages, it's clear humans don't /need/ carbohydrates.  

/But it's healthy in moderation!/ What exactly is moderation? How much? How many grams per day is moderation? Is a tablespoon of Nutella 10 times a day too much? What about 8 bananas? What about 10 tablespoons of Nutella, 8 bananas, 5 cookies, a bowl of cereal with orange juice for breakfast, a good portion of pasta for dinner, a sandwich for lunch, a sweetened "yogurt" and a nut bar in between? Is it moderation? I honestly don't know.

*** Sugar is sugar is sugar (but isn't sugar)
Maybe you're annoyed at me right now for mixing sugar with other carbs. And I am mixing them. Shamelessly. Because when it comes to it, the moment they actually enter your body, the two are indistinguishable.

And I don't mean enter the mouth. Strictly speaking, our digestive tract is still the outside, just think about it like a very long hole in a human-shaped donut. So when any carbohydrate is entering the body, it is when it's been already digested, broken up by enzymes and is entering the gut wall. And that is something only monosaccharides do. Monosaccharides -- mostly glucose, fructose and galactose. All of which we call sugar. Table sugar is a disaccharide also called sucrose -- which is a glucose-fructose pair, and milk sugar -- lactose -- is a glucose-galactose pair. And starches are polysaccharides made of many glucose units. 

Is your head spinning a bit from all the sugars too?

So if we can call glucose "sugar", and we can call fructose "(fruit) sugar", and call table sugar "sugar", then I think I can very well call starches "sugar" too, if I please. By the time they enter the body they are a "sugar" anyway (whatever that might be, but glucose in this case).

So again, how do we moderate this?

*** The destiny of the sugar we eat
Do you know what happens to the sugar we eat? 
Carbohydrates get broken down into their smallest unit as they travel from the mouth to the intestines. This mostly ends up being glucose, so that is what I will talk about further.

After the gut cells take them in, they send them straight to the liver. Why? Because too much glucose in the blood is very dangerous and would literally kill us. So the liver is the gatekeeper making sure there isn't too much entering the blood stream at once. 

But the liver can't just hold it all in in the form of glucose, that doesn't work. It releases a part into the blood (that's why our blood sugar rises after eating) and it turns as much of the rest as possible into glycogen -- our animal form of "starch" made of a string of glucose molecules. But the liver can only store about a 100g of it. When that storage is full, it has no other choice than to turn it into fat and send it off to fat cells for long term storage. Or release more into the blood 

Now muscles can store some glycogen too, about 200g in the whole body, but that glycogen is unable to leave the muscle cells, so it only gets used up when all of these muscles are working. 

So the total sugar storage of the body is about 300g. Could that be the moderation limit? Weeeell, I don't know about you, but I doubt I empty my storage daily. The muscles hold 200g which is about 1000 kcal which would have to be burned daily by working those muscles. That amounts to about 80 minutes of running or two hours of cycling. 

And there is 100g -- 500 kcal in the liver. But those only get used when our insulin levels are low, so for most people eating 3-5 meals a day with carbs here and there, that would be at best during the night. But yes, a night without eating will probably deplete the liver of glycogen.

From this, 100g of carbs a day looks like a much more reasonable "moderation". But the truth is most modern people would consider that low-carb.

*** Can addicts moderate?
Moderation, this tempting elusive idea, even if we could define what it exactly means with regards to sugar, does it work when addicted?

Looking at how we treat all other addictions, I would say not. Nobody in their right mind would tell their recovering alcoholic friend to "just have one beer". We know what would happen.

And judging from my own experience, no, sugar addicts can't moderate either.

*** I used to be a grazer 
People have a lot of ideas about what an addiction looks like. I know I did. And what I was doing did not strike me as one at all.

By all accounts, I had a great relationship with food in my youth. I didn't have any negative thoughts about food. I was enjoying it without any guilt, I didn't deny myself foods I wanted, I didn't binge, nor restrict. At all. Despite being chubby, I never considered going on a diet. I felt like I ate well -- mostly homemade food, varied diet and yes, candy when I felt like it. The truth is though, I felt like candy waaay too often. I never binged, but I /grazed/. And the sum of it was... a lot. Enough that now in retrospect I recognize the signs of prediabetes I had in my early twenties.

Long story short, I ended up going on a "diet" in my mid-twenties. For health reasons. And I tried a bunch of diets in futile attempts to control my symptoms, until I ended up with carnivore, which finally fixed it all. But it also showed me, for the first time in my life, that I had a problem.

*** Falling into a deep well
I have been carnivore for a bit over 4 years now, and I'm still learning more about my addiction and how to deal with it. During these 4 years, I had probably several hundred lapses and am still counting. Thankfully, I think I'm getting better at it.

Every time I manage to stay away from anything that tastes sweet (including anything with carbs and artificial sweeteners) the cravings go away slowly. And the longer I am without it, the less I crave it.

Yet it's enough with the tiniest smallest taste of sweetness and I'm lost. Suddenly, sweet treats are all I can think of and I want them so bad I could cry. Suddenly, I don't care that I will feel physically terrible for a few days if I eat it. Suddenly, nothing else matters anymore and I will be sneaking a sweet bite after a sweet bite, telling myself it's the last one and knowing that that is not true already before I swallow it.

For a long time, the only way I knew how to get out of this and just /stop/ was to have a binge. To eat as much candy as I wanted to. And while it would feel liberating and amazing, it also made me completely sick. Headaches, heartburn, bloat and diarrhea, sometimes vomiting, rashes and raging anxiety. Enough of a reminder and motivation to give me a chance to get out of it. 

It would take days of misery and cravings to get back to normal. If I managed at all. Often I would just fail again before I got there. 

It feels like falling into a well. One moment I am walking on a flat field, then I see a little dip in the ground and don't think much about it. But alas, it's not a little dip, it's a deep well. And climbing out of it takes days and the tiniest mistake makes me fall back down. A binge felt like letting myself sink to the rock bottom to use it as a springboard. But it was still a tough climb. When I would finally get out I could see the field ahead of me covered in wells...

*** Abstain or embrace the sugar life
I have quit sugar more times now than I can count. And the withdrawal period is the worst. It's a time of complete misery, cravings that are more about /need/ than /want/ and that consume all my thoughts. A time of heightened anxiety and physical discomfort.

The way I see it, I have two choices: abstain - completely and forever; or embrace the sugar life. And it's not really a choice. Because I can't get back on the path to diabetes, heart disease and dementia that I was on. Only when all of it disappeared, I realized how sick I actually was - gastrointestinal issues, skin issues, autoimmune issues, mental health struggles, obesity. And I know that is what would await me if I tried to go back to eating sweets. Because I just /can't/ moderate them. I have tried. Desperately. But the need to have more will always torture me until I give in. Or until I abstain long enough for it to go away.  

And as much as I love candy, I love the freedom of not wanting it much more.

*** Addiction is not simple
When I was young and stupid, I used to wonder how people could get/stay addicted to something. I didn't understand why anyone would willingly do something that was so bad for them. Ha! Now I know. I know better than I would like.

The carnivore diet is a wonderful tool in this fight, because it keeps me healthy, satiated and satisfied while being able to avoid everything sweet. It only takes 7-10 days for it to remove all the physical cravings. The mental ones though...

Addiction isn't just a chemical thing in the brain, it's not just about dopamine and neurotransmitters. It's about people, happiness, belonging, despair, coping,...

We know that even [[https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/add.14481][rats won't get addicted if they live in a "rat paradise"]], like they did in this study. And we know that [[https://doi.org/10.3109/00952997609014295][most of the soldiers who did drugs in Vietnam simply stopped when they returned home]]. There simply wasn't need for it anymore.

So I am slowly learning and discovering how I used sugar to deal with negative emotions and how I still want it when I feel down. I feel like I lost my crutch now and have to learn to walk on my own. It has been a long journey, and it's far from over, but I am getting better. I no longer binge after a small slip-up, I have learned to simply stop again, to not let myself fall all the way down into the well.

Maybe one day, there will be no wells. Maybe one day, I will even be able to moderate. But I have accepted that that might never happen, and I am OK with that. I gained much, much more than I lost by giving up sugar.

Have you ever seen a fat giraffe? No, me neither. Not even in a zoo. 

The fact that animals in the wild don’t get overweight is often chalked up to the fact that they get a lot of physical activity. But the same seems to apply to animals in zoos, in their miniature enclosures. 

Yet maintaining a healthy body weight is so difficult for us humans. And for a lot of animals living with us too, like our cats and dogs.

There are probably several magical ingredients in the soup of humanity that make us who we are; like big brains, opposable thumbs and a tendency to cooperate. And among these, we can definitely list our gait too.

The way we humans walk is unique in the natural world. Moving around on two legs freed up those opposable thumbs for other purposes, allowed us to throw things, carry things and use tools. It placed our heads higher up, allowing us to see further. It was an extremely successful adaptation that opened up an ocean of possibilities.

But, let's be honest, it's also an absolutely ridiculous way to stand. No engineer with a sane mind would even dream of designing something like this. Tall, lanky figures balancing on two small platforms. We are so used to seeing ourselves that we don't realize how unlikely this configuration is. And it's that much more magical that it works as perfectly as it does. The human gait definitely deserves an ode.

*** Learning to walk
Walking is a super basic skill for most animals. They are usually at it within minutes to days after being born or hatching. Not so us, humans. It takes about a year for a baby to crack the code and by then they are still very very far from running, jumping and standing on one leg. It takes several years for a child to master all the facets of human locomotion.

Working up to walking is a long process that starts way before the baby is ready to stand up. All the stages before that, from rolling, through lying on the belly propped up on bent arms, reaching, crawling and squatting, are important precursors to walking. They prepare the brain for the ultimate feat of using two feet to move around. They hone the basic movement patterns on which more complex movement is built, so that they become ingrained in our brains and bodies as automatic reactions. We learn about contra-lateral movement, about gravity, about stabilizing our core. We train the brain and we train the muscles. 

*** Every cat walks the same, every humans walks their own way
The path to walking is ready in our brains from the moment we are born. Just like all animals, we have the reflexes and the instincts; walking is in our DNA and our bodies know how to get there. But unlike most animals, it's a much more complicated process for humans that requires much more trial and error, testing, play and practice. There is really no need to teach a baby to walk, their biology will get them there. All they need is the right environmental inputs; which consist of a surface to move around on and people to interact with (and as little time spent in "containers" as possible).

Because gait is so much more complex for people than it is for animals, it can't be instinctual to the same level. While a cat or a giraffe will learn to walk in record time, simply following their instincts, we need to learn. The instincts are guiding us, showing us when we are on the right path, but we still have to walk it ourselves. And that's why -- unlike cats that all walk alike -- we don't.

When I was about 11, I started getting near-sighted. It took a while before anyone realized I wasn't seeing as well as I should, so I spent about a year looking at a blurry world. It was a bit tricky recognizing people from a distance. I just couldn't make out their faces. But one thing I could see from far away was the way they were walking, and I learned to tell all my family and friends apart by their gait. By their pace, the rhythm, the bounce, how their heels would strike the ground and how they would lift off, how their knees moved. I didn't learn it consciously, it just happened. And I never really stopped noticing.

People walk in such a huge variety of ways. The differences arise from learning under different circumstances, having slightly different bodies and different role models. They can be a result of injuries, small and big. It's fascinating how gait is something that adapts to the environment, but also how we subconsciously copy the people around us.

*** Walking is magic
I mentioned earlier that no sane engineer would have designed us this way, but that doesn't mean we are designed badly. It's just that we are designed based on principles that aren't commonplace in engineering. We are designed for mobility above else. We aren't a tower, we are more like a pendulum -- always in motion, moving closer and further to equilibrium. But a pendulum is not the perfect metaphor either. It captures the balancing and the constant oscillations about the equilibrium point, but a pendulum is a slave to gravity, which we are very much not. We play with gravity.

Did you know that you spend about 80% of your walking time standing on one foot? 80%! It's a lot, isn't it? That's why balancing is such a crucial skill, you literally need it to walk. Do you think your center of gravity moves from left to right when walking, in order to be right above the standing foot? It is tempting to think so. That would be the most stable position. But it doesn't. (Or at least, shouldn't.) It moves side to side slightly, but not nearly as far as being above the standing foot during the stride. Just think about how people walk; their hips and torso are not traveling side to side much at all. Yet, we don't keel over. That is because we have muscles that are holding us up, tensing in just the right places to make up for the pull of gravity.

We are not towers, and we are not pendulums. We are dynamic, living tensegrity structures.

Tensegrity (tensional integrity) is a term from architecture that describes structures built from two types of elements: hard rods that aren't directly connected to each other, and ropes that are holding them together. It's easier to understand from a picture.

#+attr_html: :alt A picture of a colorful toy made of sticks that are not touching each other, but are connected by a bunch of rubber bands.
#+caption: A kids' tensegrity toy. You know, start them early.

The hard rods are not compressible, while the ropes or rubber bands are providing tension that keeps them up, standing even when they look like they shouldn't. I always felt like they looked a little organic, a little magical, a little ethereal. And that is what we are too. A bunch of hard rods (bones) connected with rubber bands (tendons, ligaments, fascia and muscles).

It is a beautiful system that gives us incredible mobility and balance, while having all the stability we need. That is why our center of gravity doesn't have to be directly above the base of support (by which I mean the standing foot) when we are mid-step. The muscles on the outside of the thigh work like tensioned ropes and hold everything up against gravity.

There is even more to it. You probably don't realize it, but you are using your tendons and muscles like springs to store some of the energy of your step, so that they can release it, when it's their time to push you forward. We do it both when running and when walking, but the human gait is actually ridiculously efficient. [[https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.0703267104][We only use about a quarter of the energy that chimpanzees use for walking]] (whether they walk on two legs or four). We are pretty much made for it.  

*** Be a human -- walk
Walking is a full body exercise. To achieve that level of efficiency, to maintain balance and to be able to do it comfortably over a long time, much more of our body is involved than just the legs. The torso and the arms are doing a lot of work stabilizing and compensating for the rotation in the hips.

It shouldn't be surprising that walking is good for us. It is an input that our bodies evolved with and rely on to maintain themselves. Walking is important for bone density, to help with digestion and blood flow to the whole body, to keep the pelvic floor healthy, the butt strong and the hamstrings functional.

I know everyone always recommends to "just walk", or "at least walk" and we all think there is no point, because it doesn't do that much. But it really does. 

Walking is a wonderful form of movement; it's healthy, practical, pleasant and almost always available. If you have the privilege to be able to walk, I encourage you to use it.

:END:

I have been struggling with sugar addiction for years. It took its toll on both my physical and mental health long before I even knew I had it and I have been fighting it ever since I recognized its ugly face. And just like it tends to be with addictions, it was a very tough battle, and I wasn't always winning. I was ready to fight for the rest of my life, but now I think I might not have to. I think, carefully and hopefully, that I maybe, just maybe, might have won. How? Believe it or not, it was hypnosis.

*** What? Hypnosis?!
I wrote extensively [[https://noriparelius.com/post/blind-spot/][about my sugar addiction before]], so if you want to read more about the misery it brought me, just go ahead. This post will be about what liberated me.

I met Roger in a book club. (I really hope, Roger, that you don't mind me talking about this on my blog that nobody reads.) The most wonderful book club, full of lovely people from all around the world, that I feel genuinely lucky to have met. Roger is one of them -- a Scottish guy that just seems to radiate warmth, calm and wit. And as it happens, he runs a company selling hypnosis audio tracks. I remember when I found out about that a few months after joining the book club. "That's not something you hear often!" I thought, and pretty much left it at that.

At one of the book club meetings we were discussing mental health. It was one of those moments when you get to see that everybody really does have their own secret struggle, no matter the image they present to the world. Anyway, it was after that meeting that Roger recommended hypnosis to the rest of us. I knew very little about hypnosis and I never would have thought about it on my own, but getting a recommendation from someone whose opinion I have come to value, was enough to get me to try. 

Roger is one of the directors in a company called Uncommon Knowledge (I love the name!) and their [[https://www.hypnosisdownloads.com/][Hypnosis Downloads platform]] has thousands of audio tracks that you download and listen to whenever you feel like it. Literally thousands of short 20-30 minute sessions about anything and everything you could think of. (And by the way, this is not an ad, I'm getting nothing for this. I just genuinely love their stuff.)

*** You wouldn't give a cake to an itchy knee
I didn't know where to start, but I knew about at least one big problem I had. The damn sugar. So I started looking for hypnosis tracks that could help with that. I found a few and tried a few, downloads with names like Sweet Tooth and Food Addiction Help. I did as was recommended and listened to them every day for a week. They were nice, calming, lovely to listen to and I agreed with every word. But I didn't feel any different. I thought maybe I just needed to give it more time. Until I ran into the Stop Emotional Eating. It's funny, because I already knew that one of the reasons I was turning to "treats" was emotions; boredom, angst, loneliness, exhaustion, stress,... But knowing didn't help me to stop.

The first time I listened to Stop Emotional Eating felt like an emotional rollercoaster ride that ended with me disembarking into a new reality. I opened my eyes and wondered why on earth I ever tried to eat away my feelings. What an utterly stupid idea! As if that would ever work! It suddenly seemed completely silly and useless to eat an ice cream because I had a bad day (or a good one, for that matter). The hypnosis was full of deep insights and clever metaphors, and it reached a part of my mind no logic could ever penetrate to before. I still chuckle at the "You wouldn't give a cake to an itchy knee" whenever I think about it. Very true, I definitely wouldn't do that, but I spent decades doing its equivalent by putting a plaster made of chocolate over my feelings. No more though. No more.

*** Break the trance
Now, I was really feeling that my sugar struggles were over. And in some way they were! It's been a half a year and I didn't have a single binge in that time. What's even more, I didn't even want one, or get anywhere close. My emotions seemed to have detangled themselves from the food completely and permanently.

But. Oh yes, there is a but. I wasn't binging anymore, and I wasn't tortured by wanting something sweet more than anything, but kept nibbling at foods I knew would make me feel sick when nobody was looking. To be honest, I can't explain it. I would have a little bite of a banana pancake I made for my kids. Or a piece of blood sausage. Or an apple. All pretty good foods, but ones that unfortunately don't do me, personally, any good. I only did it when nobody was looking, while firmly telling myself that I don't want to do that, that it isn't worth it and that I don't even want it that much. I still did it. Over and over again. Mind-boggling. Thankfully, it didn't trigger the binges and I didn't really feel that unsatiable need for candy anymore.

I regret to say that it took me months to realize this was something else than the emotional eating I was partaking in before. It needed a different mind-shift. And lo and behold, I found a hypnosis for that too! Wanna guess? It's called Secret Eating. I only listened to that one once, about 6 weeks ago. And I haven't been grazing on things anymore. At all. And the best thing is that it is effortless. No willpower needed. Looking back, the moments I stole from my kids food felt like some sort of trance. My brain saw the opportunity, nobody was looking, so it didn't count. The reaction was almost automatic, no matter what I was trying to tell myself at that moment. The hypnosis broke the trance and put me back in control. 

*** Everyday magic
I know the word hypnosis sounds spooky and for quite a while after starting with it I felt a bit silly asking my husband to keep the kids away from me for twenty minutes, because I was going to do a... /hypnosis/. Truth is, there is nothing spooky or weird to it. It is actually a lot like what people call guided meditations now. You sit/lie down, relax, and listen to someone talking. No loss of control involved at all. You are completely free to disagree with whatever they are saying, or stop the track at any moment. In a sense, the whole experience doesn't feel special at all. No dangling watches, no whirlwinds in the eyes, no repressed memories, no waking up and realizing you were jumping around like a frog unbeknownst to you just seconds before. In that sense it's almost boring. 

But there is real magic to it too. I have told myself countless times before that eating something sweet would only make me feel sick and not actually calm the emotional storm I was drowning in. My thoughts never reached my feelings though. I have spent over 4 years trying to use willpower, tricks and hacks, trying to motivate myself, remind myself, rationalize and my progress was glacial at best. One single hypnosis session solving it all? That is a miracle.

*** Doesn't matter how you got there
What I really like about hypnosis, or at least the hypnosis from [[https://www.hypnosisdownloads.com/][Hypnosis Downloads]] / Uncommon Knowledge, is that it is always about the solution. There is rarely digging into what kind of trauma brought you were you are, because it doesn't really matter. The real question is how you get out.

I remember doing a "guided meditation" several years ago, which was all about meeting your demons and transforming them. It was a very cool experience, fairy-tale like and full of surprises. I met my sugar demon, a pink blobby creature with a funny hat. I talked to it, and could clearly see that what it was all about was hunger not for food, but for safety, connection, love and other things candy couldn't give. I got to see it for the coping mechanism it was. Then I  witnessed it transform from the monster into a hurt little me.

I don't know, maybe for some people that meditation would have been enough to leave the addiction behind. For me, it wasn't. It illuminated where I was and how I got there, but it also revealed to me what my addiction was doing /for/ me, why I /needed/ it. I didn't know how else to take care of those needs.

The Emotional Eating hypnosis was so much more pragmatic than the esoteric experience of meeting my demons. "You wouldn't give a cake to an itchy knee," is exactly what I needed to hear though. It didn't concern itself with why I was eating my feelings, which feelings, or where and when it might have started. What mattered was that it was an absolutely useless coping mechanism.

The hypnosis also offered a solution. A solution so painfully obvious, that it shouldn't need to be said, but for me, it was. I was told that I should take care of my emotional needs in the appropriate way, and only use food for hunger. Sounds vague, but in the days after I first listened to the track, I suddenly started becoming aware of my emotional needs that I didn't notice before. Now they were right there in front of me clear as day, and it felt ridiculous to shove a cookie in my face in a futile attempt to make them go away. 

*** A key to the mind
Ever since my first positive experiences with hypnosis, I have been turning to it almost daily, trying out various tracks.

I have been working on getting better at taking breaks, learning to compartmentalise my work and free time, let go of caring what others think about me, even getting better at creative writing! (I actually started writing a novel! Doing creative writing for the first time since high school! How fun is that?!)

Whenever I run into a problem in my life, a situation where I would wish I would feel and react differently, I look for the right track. It usually takes trying a few different, related ones, sort of like testing a bunch of keys on a stubborn lock. Sooner or later, one of them fits. Sometimes the change is slow and sneaky, sometimes it's like a lightning strike, but it is always, always, life-changing. 

If you find any of this intriguing, and you are wondering how hypnosis actually works, go and read about it from the experts. Here is a great article by Mark Tyrrell -- the other founder behind Uncommon Knowledge -- about [[https://www.hypnosisdownloads.com/blog/hypnosis-what-is-it-and-how-does-it-work][what hypnosis is]].

Humans are probably the only creatures in the world that are confused about what they should be eating.

Pandas eat bambus, koalas eucalyptys. Cows eat grasses and wolves eat meat. Most animals have a very limited menu. Yet humans are trying to eat "a varied diet", to "eat the rainbow". Something that wouldn't make sense for most animals on Earth.

What are we meant to eat? What is the natural human diet?

Team of scientist from Israel and Portugal tried to answer just that in [[https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/ajpa.24247][a study about the trophic level of our ancestors]] (in other words, where on the food chain our ancestors were).

*** Human omnivore -- but what else?
There is not much doubt about humans being omnivores. We can digest and use both plant and animal foods and the authors of the study are pointing to a number of archeological findings that show us eating both for a long time.

The real question though is, how much of what did we eat?

Most mammals are, just like us, omnivores, but most of these omnivores have strong preferences for either animal, or plant food. Even chimpanzees and wolves are in reality omnivores, altough wolves only eat plants if they have to, and chimpanzees indulge in animal foods only occasionally.

Where do humans fall on this scale?

*** The true paleo diet
How did our hunter-gatherer ancestors eat in the time between 2.5 million years ago and 12 000 years ago? If we can answer this question, we will get a much better idea of what our own bodies expect as fuel. The agricultural revolution started for only about 10 000 years ago, while our species -- Homo -- has existed in much the same form for more than 2 million years. That means that if Homo had emerged one hour ago, we would still have been hunters and gatherers just 20 seconds ago. The agriculture is still very much news for our genetics and our bodies.

So what did our ancestors hunt and gather?

*** Studied from every side
In this study, the authors looked at a great number of factors, parts of our physiology and genetics, archeological and paleontological finding, and etnographic evidence. They gathered almost 30 different clues showing how our ancestors were eating and how their menus evolved through the ages.

*** Man -- the fat hunter
In short, their conclusion was that since the birth of our genus Homo more than 2 million years ago, until the very recent times of about 15 000 years ago, we have mostly been eating the flesh of big mammals. Plants were a small addition to our diet -- most likely in the times when the hunt was not successful.

And not only we were mostly carnivorous, we actually ate as much fat as we could get our hands on. The main author of the study, Miki Ben-Dor called us "fat hunters". We know this, because the archeological and paleontological findings are showing that we were always going for the most fatty indviduals in the herd, even though they were more difficult to catch than the old and the sick ones.

Here I briefly summarize some of the other arguments showing we were predators of big animals:
- *high energy demands* -- humans require a lot of energy, and it would not have been possible for us to get all the calories we needed from plants (wild paleolitic plants -- modern produce bread for high sugar and starch yield would get us closer)
- *fat reserves* -- unlike other primates, we can store a considerable amount of fat on our bodies -- a necessity for when hunting wasn't successful
- *genetic adaptation to fat digestion* -- some of our genes that we share with chimpanzees have been turned off, to allow us to digest large amounts of fat
- *low stomach pH* -- our stomachs are more acidic than those of most carnivores; we have the pH of carion-eaters
- *intestinal system* -- our intestines resemble carnivores more than chimpanzees -- we have a long small intestine and short large intestine
- *insulin resistance* -- our response to insulin is less pronounced, more like that of carnivores
- *less chewing* -- compared to our very, very old ancestors who were still more similar to apes, already the paleolitic humans had a much less developed chewing muscles, which suggests they were eating soft foods -- meat and fat
- *a body adapted for hunt* -- since we evolved from apes, we didn't have a chance to inherit huge teeth or claws; instead, we got shoulders and arms that could learn to throw spears, and legs and stamina allowing for persistance hunting
- *a lot of small fat cells* - surprisingly, the size of the fat cells of an organism correlates very closely with their carnivory level; herbivores store their fat in a few big cells, while carnivores in many small ones -- ours are one of the smallest in the animal world
- *vitamins* -- compared calorie for calorie, animal foods are much denser in 8 out of 10 vitamins that humans require, in most cases several times more dense -- we would have had trouble getting all we needed from plants
- *social behaviour* -- food sharing, labour distribution and sharing the responsibility of raising the young are more common for predators
- *age at weaning* -- we differ a lot from other primates when it comes to the age of weaning -- other primates wean much, much later (at 4.5-8 years) than even the modern hunter-gatherer societies (around 2.5 years) -- it's common for carnivores to wean earlier than herbivores
- *longevity* -- we live much longer than our ape relatives -- maybe because the experience of elders was much more important for hunting and this evolutionary pressure favoured longevity
- *lack of dental cavities* -- for most of our history, cavities were very rare, they started appearing as we relied on plant foods more and more
- *analysis of radioactive istotopes* -- the analysis of paleontological finding suggests that we were at the trophic level of wolves up to about 15 000 years ago.

*** The world of our ancestors was different
The authors of the study also talk a lot about how we can't simply look at the diets of modern hunter-gatherers and believe our ancestors ate the same. The world has changed since, and we don't see the herds of woolly mammoths, mastodonts, nor bisons anymore. There are fewer species of big mammals on Earth now and even those remaining, like elephants, have low population numbers.

Modern hunters and gatherers have no chance to live the way they could have a million years ago. Maybe that is one of the reasons we are so confused about what we should eat. Our natural food source might not exist anymore. But thank gods we learned how to keep cows and make bacon.

*** More plants on the plate
How much plant matter we were eating was changing over the millenia. Eating meat, however, was what allowed us to develop our big brains and differentiate ourselves from our closest ape relatives. For a human to become a human, we had to be carnivores.

Plants started to take a bigger and bigger part in our diet about 15 000 years ago, so after about 2 million years of almost pure carnivory. This change was happening at a time when big mammals began to go extinct and this forced us to change our diets. Scientists can follow this change by looking at stable isotope analyses, appearance of tools made to process plants and more and more dental caries in the teeth of our ancestors at that time. Apart from cavities, this change also brought on a [[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/06/110615094514.htm][decrease in our average height and in the size of our brains]], and that is where we still are today. (I mean, we are shorter and with smaller heads than our genetically pretty much identical ancestors from 15 000 years ago. Crazy, isn't it?)

/(The image above is AI generated, the rest is not.)/

I believe this is my fifth(?!) attempt at blogging in the last 12 years. Some of those blogs were very short-lived, some survived for longer. None of the previous four are out there anymore. I had my reasons for starting each of the blogs, but it wasn't something I thought about much, not something that was clear in my mind. As I was starting yet another blog (this one), I decided to be a bit more mindful and conscious of what my goals actually are. Because if you don't know where you want to go, every step you take is in the wrong direction.

So here are my 5 reasons for blogging!

*** 1. Sorting out my thoughts
I think a bunch. This is not a brag, by the way, I am not saying that I think more than others, and I am definitely not so certain this is good for me. But the fact is that I think enough for it to often get crowded in my head. For my sanity, it's pretty useful to get those things out.

David McCullough said "Writing is thinking," and I very much agree with that sentiment. Writing helps me sort out my thoughts. Somehow, it's the best way for me to even find out /what/ exactly I am thinking. In a way, I never quite know what will come out of it when I start, but that is one of its best benefits to me. It allows me to clarify my thoughts to myself. 

While thinking itself can be passive, writing, on the other hand, is active. It gives the thoughts a concrete form, turns them from possibilities into /things/. Even if it's "only" words, those words are an act of creation. 

*** 2. Learning by explaining
Related to the previous point, explaining things, whether in writing or by talking through them, is one of the best ways to make sure that you understand things. Trying to put your knowledge into a digestible format that can be understood by others is one of the best ways to see where the gaps are, and it creates an incentive to fill them.

Richard Feynman was a big proponent of learning by trying to explain things to others It helped him finding out where he lacked knowledge, then he looked up what was missing, learned more and then did it all again. And again, and again. The Feynman technique (that is really what it is called) is just one of many within the "learning by teaching" framework. Even explaining things to an inanimate object improves learning, hence the existence of the "plastic platypus learning" technique (yes, that is its real name). (Now I kind of want a plastic platypus.)

*** Note
One might argue, that these first two points only require writing, and maybe a plastic platypus, but can be done without plastering the writing all over the internet. And that is true. There are countless ways to achieve these goals, but I like blogging, because knowing others might read what I write forces me to write it with much more care than I would just for myself or for a plastic platypus, however cute.  

*** 3. Getting better at writing
Does every teenager want to become a writer? I used to think so, then I asked a few people, and found out they don't. But I did. I also thought it was one of those silly dreams that you better not think too much about. How dumb is that?! Well, I finally got old enough and wise enough to realise that I might never be a /writer/, but there is nothing stopping me from being a writer. Nothing other than myself. Because making a living out of it is not at all required to being a writer. 

As it is with any skill, be it pottery or skiing or coding or decorating cakes to look like real objects, you get better at it by doing it. Quantity leads to quality.

There is a story about a photography class in which the teacher told half of the students that they will be graded solely on the quantity of the photographs they take, while the other group was supposed to only take one single picture -- a culmination of their knowledge, planning and preparations. At the end of the course, all the best photographs came from the "quantity" group. Absolutely all of them.

I read this story first in Atomic Habits by James Clear, then again in Show Your Work! by Austin Kleon, but this time with pottery instead of photography. [[https://austinkleon.com/2020/12/10/quantity-leads-to-quality-the-origin-of-a-parable/][Austin Kleon investigated why there are two versions of this story]], and found out it really did happen in a photography class, but was first told by David Bayles and Ted Orland in the book Art & Fear, and they felt it fit better when changed to pottery.

I feel like the story works perfectly well with both photography and pottery, and the two versions of it illustrate how universal it actually is. Quantity doesn't trump quality, but it does lead to it.

And so my goal is to practice my writing.

*** 4. Gathering memories
This is a point I haven't reached yet. I have deleted my old blogs, although I do keep some of my favourite old articles in my own archives. But I am looking forward to one day browsing through things I wrote 5, 10 or 20 years ago. Reminding me how my life was back then, what I was thinking about. Some of it will definitely feel outdated, maybe even cringe, but I think it will be fun.

*** 5. Connecting with other people
Lastly, I want to publish my writings so that others can read them.

I often doubt whether my writing makes any sense, whether anyone wants to read it at all, whether I should just give up and climb under a rock. But life is too short and too weird for (self-)censorship, so I am doing my best to work around those doubts.

Truth is, I want people to read what I write. I want to know what they think. I want to test my ideas by showing them to others. I want to share the things I discovered, that make my life better or bring me join. I hope I might help someone, or inspire them, even if I only inspire them to prove me wrong on something.

Now that I am thinking about it, my blogging already turned a distant acquaintance into one of my now best friends. (Shoutout to Mariš!) I don't see where and how we would have gotten to know each other if I didn't step out of my comfort zone and started writing. So I guess it is working. 

*** What I didn't mention
An attentive reader might notice that I didn't talk about some things that many people nowadays aim for when starting a blog. There are no mentions of traffic, marketing, or growth. In short, no money.

Let's not sand-paper our eyes, who wouldn't want some extra money, right? (Btw, sand-papering your eyes is a great Slovak expression for denying the obvious. I am trying to introduce it to English. Is it working?) Anyway, yes, money.

Truth is, the last blog before this one was my attempt to start an online business. And I hated it. It was fun at first, then it wasn't. I wrote a whole [[https://noriparelius.com/post/i-failed-at-starting-an-online-business/][blog post about how I failed at starting an online business, and why I'm happy with that]]. I still think it's super neat that people can make money online, and I definitely believe that creators should be paid for what they do and provide. But the way I was trying to go about it just didn't feel right for me.

Thankfully, I don't need to make money from blogging, and I have a bunch of other wonderful reason for pursuing it. I am very happy to just blog for fun, as a hobby, about whatever I want. Simply to enrich my life, and maybe, if I am lucky, someone else's too.
