# My website noriparelius.com

This is the source code for my website [noriparelius.com](https://noriparelius.com)

I write in Emacs using org-mode, then use ox-hugo to transform the content into something Hugo compatible.
Hugo is my software of choice for creating the static website, which is then deployed using Netlify. The theme I use for my website is Ananke. Tadaa.
